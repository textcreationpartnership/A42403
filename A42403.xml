            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST died for <hi>All Perſons,</hi> and hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reconciled <hi>All perſons:</hi> They uſually propound a certain diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the ground of what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prove.</p>
            <p>Which Drſtinction of theirs poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at a two-fold Redemption.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98399:6"/>The <hi>Firſt,</hi> (ſay they) is a Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Reconciliation and Salvation wrought by Jeſus Chriſt <hi>in his own body, with God for men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> (ſay they) is a Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reconciliation, and Salvation wrought by his <hi>Spirit in Men to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> they call a reconciling of <hi>God to Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> they call a reconciling of <hi>Man to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which diſtinction of theirs, in their ſenſe, will appeare to be weak from a twofold conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in that the Scripture war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranteth no ſuch diſtinction in their ſenſe. Mr. <hi>Denne,</hi> when hee begins to treat of the reconciliation of God to Man, hee confeſſeth in his fifth page of that Treatiſe, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ſpoken of him that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an enemy, Neither indeed doe I find this diſtinction to be agreeable either to the Doctrine or Language of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in that theſe things
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98399:6"/>are propounded by them rather in way of Separation then Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For (ſay they) CHRIST hath wrought Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for <hi>All perſons, (before God)</hi> but he hath not wrought Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation for <hi>All Perſons (in themſelves.</hi> And thus they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide CHRIST and his Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
            <p>Now, in ſearching of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wee ſhall finde, that when mention is made of Redemption, Reconciliation, and Salvation, as concerning perſons <hi>redeemed;</hi> wee are to underſtand it to be ſpoken of thoſe who are reconciled unto God, or made partakers of Redemption, Reconciliation, Juſtification, and Salvation, in themſelves, before God, by JESUS CHRIST. So we are to underſtand theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures following, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Romans</hi> 3.25. <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 2.17. <hi>Epheſians</hi> 2.16.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98399:7"/>compared with 13, 14, and 15 ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Col. 1.21.</p>
            <p>And it will not bee impertinent to the thing in hand, if we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſider,</p>
            <p>That when mention is made of Reconciliation, Propitiation, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onement made, or to be made for any perſons under the Law, we muſt underſtand it to bee ſpoken of ſuch an Atonement or Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, as was wrought for them, and they were legally partakers of in themſelves, before GOD, by meanes of thoſe Sacrifices offered for them, which were a Figure of Jeſus Chriſt. To this purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe Scriptures following, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.4. and 4.20.26, 31, 35. and 6.7. and 12.7.8. and 16.33. and 23.27.28. <hi>Numbers</hi> 8.19. and 25.13. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.24. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi> 10.33.</p>
            <p>And truly (as anſwering thoſe Figures) whenſoever wee read of reconciliation, Propitiation, or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement made for any perſons
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98399:7"/>by Jeſus Chriſt; wee are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it to bee ſpoken of ſuch a Reconciliation or Atonement, as was obtained for them, and they were partakers of in themſelves, before God, by means of that <hi>One Sacrifice Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>Once</hi> offered, to bring them into a glorious eſtate of perſecution, and to uphold and preſerve them in the ſame for ever. This is moſt cleare from what is writren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. and 14. verſes compared together. And hitherto is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.11. <hi>When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne.</hi> And, <hi>We joy in God through our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by whom wee have now received the Atonement.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> as an addition to the former diſtinction, in the fifth page of his book, ſaith, The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was by Blood-ſhedding, the latter by Blood-ſprinkling, or waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

            <p>I ſhall make it appeare in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell of the Treatiſe, that all the blood which Chriſt did ſhed, is the blood of <hi>Sprinkling.</hi> Whereby it will appeare how unſound in it ſelf, and how diſhonorable to Chriſt his diſtinction is.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe Scriptures, to wit, <hi>John</hi> 4.42. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.24. <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 2.9. 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.29. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 3.24. and <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 9.14. which in his ſecond page hee alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth for the proving of the former diſtinction.</p>
            <p>I ſhall through the Lords helpe, make it appeare in the ſequell of this diſcourſe alſo, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, (and that according to their proper meaning) in another ſenſe then he puts upon them. And that they are, all of them, ſpoken of ſuch, who are <hi>partakers in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God,</hi> of reconciliation, atonement, remiſſion of ſinnes, and ſalvation by the price and power of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98399:8"/>the death or blood-ſhed of Ieſus Chriſt.
<q>And wheras in pag. 22. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſeveral <hi>ends</hi> of the death of Chriſt, (and that aptly in ſome things) He ſaith that when the death of Chriſt in reſpect of that <hi>end,</hi> which was for <hi>propitiation</hi> and <hi>ranſome</hi> is onely mentioned, as it is for all, (ſaith he) ſo it is expreſt in ſuch generall words onely, as the World, all men, &amp;c. And for this he alledgeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.15.19. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> 2.9.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to which, The Reader muſt conſider, that this <hi>Concluſion</hi> of his belongs to the firſt part of their diſtinction. And as their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is in it ſelfe unſound, as will be ſtill more evident by the conſequent matter: So his <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> is vnſound alſo; Which will appeare from what is written in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.28. In which Scripture mention is made of the death of Chriſt in reſpect of <hi>ranſome and propitiation onely, and that as a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98399:9"/>ground of faith:</hi> and yet it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in ſuch generall words, as the <hi>VVorld,</hi> or <hi>all Men.</hi> For it is there ſaid, <hi>Chriſt was once offered to beare the ſins of many, and unto them that looke for him ſhall hee appeare the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time without ſinne unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Mind it, He was once offered to beare ſinnes; Here is the <hi>end</hi> of his death in reſpect of <hi>ranſome,</hi> and <hi>propitiation onely,</hi> and yet it is not applyed vnto <hi>all perſons,</hi> but unto many.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe 3. Scriptures alledged by him to maintaine his <hi>Concluſion,</hi> I ſhall ſpeake ſomething to them in their due place.</p>
            <p>And before J leave this <hi>diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> J cannot but give you to take notice, That, Mr. DENN, in his
<q>
                  <hi>Drag-net page</hi> 80. <hi>doth not let to affirme, That Ieſus Chriſt redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all perſons, according to the ſecond part of their diſtinction: to wit, In drawing them to himſelfe, by the workings of his Spirit in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98399:9"/>them.</hi>
               </q> To which purpoſe he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth what is written in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt dayes (ſaith God) I will powre out of my Spirit upon all fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> This pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> hee ſaith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to <hi>all perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, If wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> What is the <hi>matter</hi> of the promiſe, together with the <hi>meaſure</hi> of it: to wit, <hi>The powring forth of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Time</hi> appointed for the performance of it: <hi>Jt ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What is meant here by <hi>all fleſh:</hi> Which concerneth the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> intereſted in this promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What are the <hi>effects</hi> of the performance of this promiſe: to wit, <hi>Your Sonnes and Daughters ſhall propheſie &amp;c.</hi> I ſay, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and underſtand theſe things. It will appeare how weakely, and wrongfully Mr. <hi>Denn</hi> applyeth this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98399:10"/>Scripture to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And as for his following Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which he alledgeth to the ſame purpoſe, If he will mind, and duely weigh them, in their ſeverall circumſtances and expreſſions, he may ſee, that they hold not forth the ſame thing which that in the <hi>Acts</hi> doth. And as for his interpretation of the words of Chriſt, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.32 (which are the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of that his diſcourſe, which he cals the <hi>Drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>) I ſhall in the ſequel of my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe (in opening the ſame words) diſcover what an unſound ſenſe he puts upon them. Now of the things before ſpoken, this is the ſumme.</p>
            <p>Whenſoever we read of <hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, redemption, reconciliation,</hi> as touching perſons <hi>redeemed, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> or <hi>ſaved</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt. We are to underſtand, That it is ſuch an <hi>Atonement, reconciliation</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> which they are partakers of in themſelves, before God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the riches of his grace, by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98399:10"/>Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Which good pleaſure and grace of God was given them in Chriſt Ieſus, before the world began, But is now made manifeſt by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And is then made manifeſt in the hearts of thoſe, to whom Jeſus Chriſt appeareth, aboliſhing death, and bringing life and immortality to light through the Goſpel, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.10. This that I have ſaid may ſerve thus farre to cleare the <hi>truth,</hi> and to diſcover the unſoundneſſe of that <hi>diſtinction,</hi> or rather <hi>ſeparation</hi> which they make in the redemption of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> in the two laſt lines of page 23, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith; That the Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth
<q>and putteth great difference between the <hi>Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> life and Juſtification that is <hi>In Chriſt for men:</hi> and the ſame <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon or In men</hi> through the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Chriſt. And for this purpoſe alledgeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. and 4.24.25. and 5.6.10.11.15.18.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98399:11"/>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.10.11.12. And the former of theſe ſaith he is larger then the latter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> I doe not find that theſe Scriptures doe hold forth any ſuch diſtinction.</p>
            <p>As for that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. Where it is ſaid, <hi>We are juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, Doth he not here ſpeake of ſuch perſons, <hi>who in themſelves, before God, are freely juſtified from all their ſinnes, by the grace of God, through that redemption which is in or by Ieſus Chriſt onely, through faith in his blood; that ſo the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God in Chriſt might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he onely might appeare juſt, and the Iuſtifyer of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And whereas he alſo alledgeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. Where it is ſaid, He was delivered for our offences, and raiſed againe for our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</q>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98399:12"/>things doe ſweetly depend upon each other. And wheras he alledgeth the 15. verſe.</p>
            <p>I conceive, it doth rightly and excellently hold forth thus much, to wit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man,</hi> IESUS CHRIST, <hi>is much more, and hath abounded much more unto many, then that one offence of that one man</hi> Adam, <hi>which brought death unto them; for, ſaith he,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The judgement was by One ſinne unto condemnation: but this grace of God, and gift by grace, is of many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences unto juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Marke the abundance of this grace to whom it is given, <hi>It is of many offences unto juſtification.</hi> And therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Whereas by that One offence of that One man, death raigned by One: Much more, They which receive, this abundance of grace and of the gift of righteouſneſſe</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance indeed, for it abounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98399:13"/>their juſtification from many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences) <hi>ſhall raigne in life,</hi> (that is, <hi>ſhall much</hi> more reign in life) <hi>by One Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> This is the ſubſtance, and meaning of the 15.16. and 17. verſes.</p>
            <p>And whereas, hee further alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth verſe 18. to prove that there is life and juſtification, or juſtification of life <hi>Jn Chriſt for All perſons;</hi> for ſo he ſaith in page 23. line 7.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That which the Apoſtle ſtill driveth at is to ſhew, That the grace of God, and the gift by grace which is by Ieſus Chriſt hath much more abounded above the offence of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Effect</hi> of it; for ſaith he,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As by that One offence of One man, judgement came upon all men unto condemnation:</hi> that is, It came pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully upon them. <hi>Even ſo by that righteouſneſſe of Chriſt alone, the grace of God came upon all men unto juſtification of life:</hi> that is, It came gloriouſly and powerfully upon

            <p>"And here it is to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded how weakely and vnwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably hee alledgeth this Scripture to prove that there is life and juſtification <hi>In Chriſt (as he ſaith) for all perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When as it is moſt manifeſt that the Apoſtle in theſe words ſpeaketh of thoſe onely, who are, <hi>in themſelves, before God, through faith in Chriſt, actuall pertakers of juſtification of life by him.</hi> And this will appeare from two reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>nature</hi> of this juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It is that, which in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98399:14"/>higheſt degree ſtandeth in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to condemnation mentioned in the ſame verſe. Iuſtification of life. That is, Righteouſneſſe of life, remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, bleſſedneſſe, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, eternall life. It is the ſame Iuſtification mentioned in Chapt. 3.24.26. Chapt. 4.5. and in the 4. verſe of this Chapter alſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>application</hi> of this juſtification of life. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perſons here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>In verſe 15. it is ſaid, This exceeding grace of God, by Ieſus Chriſt, hath abounded <hi>Vnto</hi> many. And in verſe 16 it is ſaid to be <hi>Vnto</hi> their Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98399:14"/>And in this 18. ver. it is ſaid, That the grace of God, or the free gift <hi>Came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> all men <hi>Vnto</hi> Iuſtification of life. And in verſe 19. it is ſaid, That by this grace of God in Chriſt, many ſhall be <hi>Made</hi> righteous. And that which is chiefly to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved is that in verſe ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene. Where it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That this juſtification and ſalvation here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is ſpoken of thoſe onely who <hi>receive</hi> this abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſſe which is by Ieſus Chriſt. Thoſe who <hi>receive</hi> it, that is, Thoſe to whom the Lord gives his grace and righteouſneſſe by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98399:15"/>Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore you ſhall obſerve, that in the 15.16. and 17. verſes, <hi>The grace of God, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> gift: Which to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Lord gives. They ſhall reigne in life by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And thus in the opening of this Scripture it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, That by All men in the latter part of this verſe, We can neither vnderſtand all perſons from firſt to laſt. Neither can his diſtinction be juſtified from hence. For he here ſpeakes or ſuch a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of life as <hi>Commeth Vpon men,</hi> or is <hi>Given</hi> Vnto
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98399:15"/>them, according to the grace of God in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And whereas he further al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. to juſtifie his diſtinction, I ſhall cleare that in it's due place from ſuch a ſenſe: and ſhall referre the Reader to what I ſhall there lay downe in the opening of this Scripture.</p>
            <p>And whereas he further al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the firſt of <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.10.11.12.</p>
            <p>I conceive that this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture teacheth us thus much, to wit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he that beleeveth on the Sonne of God, hath the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98399:16"/>in himſelfe, and beareth record to the truth of God,</hi> to wit, That eternall life is his gift, through Jeſus Chriſt, and that this life is no way to be obtained, but through faith in Chriſt onely. And that therefore whoſoever ſeeketh for life and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by his owne workes or righteouſneſſe, or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing which ſtands in oppoſition to Jeſus Chriſt crucified, and riſen from the dead, he makes God a Lyer, becauſe hee receiveth or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not the record which God gave of his Sonne.</p>
            <p>And whereas, He thinketh to ſtrengthen his diſtinction,

            <p>I ſhall firſt ſearch and try the Scriptures they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and then proceed to the declaration and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their Reaſons.</p>
            <p>And before I enter upon the triall of the Scriptures, it is neceſſary to premiſe one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98399:20"/>caution, to wit, That it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe and unwarrantable to take all expreſsions in the Scripture, as ſimple or unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending expreſſions, not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidering their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon ſome part of the Scripture before-going, or following after, or both: For ſo doing, it is the high way to pervert the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to run headlong into dangerous opinions This rock, thoſe who made that Book, and others of their judgement, doe run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſeeking to maintaine this opinion of Generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, as it is uſually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>But it is ſafe, warrantable,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98399:21"/>and needfull in the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of many expreſſions in Scripture, to conſider well their dependance, that ſo the mind of the holy Spirit may (through his own teaching) be underſtood.</p>
            <p>This way I ſhall tread, in the interpretation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Scriptures now to bee conſidered that as the Lord gives me underſtanding, I may diſcover the minde of God in them. And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am encouraged to this undertaking becauſe I know and am perſwaded, that I have the Spirit of God, which will reveale ſpirituall things to me, yea the deep things of God.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98399:21"/>
            <p>One Scripture propounded by them to maintaine their opinion is the 2 Cor. 5.14, 15.

                  </gap> Scripture</note> The words are theſe following; For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge: that if one died for all, then were all dead. And that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them and roſe againe.</p>
            <p>In the interpretation of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<note place="margin">The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> the greateſt difficulty lyeth in the word <hi>(All)</hi> They ſay, we are here to underſtand the word univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally for all perſons, that is, <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity from firſt to laſt; I ſay we are to underſtand it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and under another conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Before I come to declare the meaning of this Scripture, I ſhall firſt give too reaſons from the words themſelves to cleare them from that corrupt ſenſe which they put upon them.
<note place="margin">Two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to cleare the words.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, All thoſe for whom Chriſt died are in time made alive by the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98399:22"/>power of his death.
<note place="margin">Two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to cleare the words.</note> This is clearly held forth in verſe 15. <hi>He died for all, that they which live,</hi> or they which are made alive, <hi>marke that.</hi> That is, He died for all to make them alive, to recover them from death, and to bring them into an eſtate of life, by his dying for them and riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. This indeed is the force and meaning of theſe words; and ſo they do agree alſo with other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The holy Spirit ſpeaketh to the ſame purpoſe, 1 Iohn 4.9. <hi>God ſent his onely begotten Sonne into the world that we might live through him.</hi> And can this be any leſſe but that the Sonne of God giveth life by his death unto all theſe for whom he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? And the ſame is taught us by the Lord Jeſus in Iohn 6.51. <hi>The bread which I will give is my fleſh which I will give for the life of the World,</hi> that is; The world ſhall be made alive by my death, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove in verſe 33. <hi>The bread of God is he which cometh downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and giveth life to the world.</hi> And if any ſhall doubt what life he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98399:22"/>ſpeakes of, they may be reſolved from Chriſt himſelfe in verſe 51. <hi>It is a life which ſhall laſt for ever.</hi> And the ſame leſſon he teacheth us in Iohn 12.32.33. <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men to me. And this he ſaid ſignifying what death he ſhould die,</hi> that is, by the vertue and power of my death, I will give life to all men, or, I will draw all men to my ſelfe. Neither do I know that the Scripture any where teacheth that Chriſt died for any, but ſuch as are in time made alive by his death. And indeed it is a moſt weak and carnall conceit, which ſome have of the death of Chriſt, who ſpeake of his death, and yet ſeperate a glorious and a living power from it. Now this being a truth (as is cleare from the words themſelves, and the harmony of theſe Scriptures above mentioned) that he died for all to make them alive, to recover them from death, and bring them into an eſtate of life: we cannot then by the word <hi>all</hi> in this place undeſtand all perſons, or every perſon, as they ſay.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:98399:23"/>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon, to cleare theſe words is taken from the nature and force of the word <hi>(for)</hi> in this place.

It ſignifieth <hi>intereſt,</hi> or <hi>propriety,</hi> and carrieth the force of promiſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in it, unto the perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein. <hi>He died (for) all;</hi> that is, they have an intereſt or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in the glory, vertue, power, life, and riches of his death: the beneſit of his death is certainly theirs for life and ſalvation to them. And truly, ſo farre as I know, this word <hi>(for)</hi> when it is uſed upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions in Scripture, <hi>as for all, for many, for thee, for us, and the like)</hi> it alwayes ſignifieth <hi>intereſt</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,</hi> and carrieth the force of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and performance in it. It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a certaine ſpeciality, right, or intereſt that thoſe perſons have in it, of whom it is ſpoken. I will give a few inſtances inſtead of many, Rom, 8.31. <hi>If God be (for) us:</hi> that is,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98399:23"/>if we have a ſpeciall <hi>intereſt, &amp; right,</hi> or <hi>propriety</hi> in him: If he be our God, our ſtrength, and our portion. And againe in the next verſe, <hi>He that ſparred not his owne Sonne, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him to death</hi> (for) <hi>us all. FOR</hi> us all, that is, we have a <hi>propriety, right,</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> in him: we do pertake in him: he is ours, and we ſhall enjoy all good, riches, bleſſings, and comforts with him, as the words following do declare. Again, Rom. 4.25. <hi>He was delivered</hi> (for) <hi>our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and was raiſed againe</hi> (for) <hi>our juſtification.</hi> that is, we have an <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, right,</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> in his death, and reſurrection, whereby we are juſtified from our ſins. Againe, Rom. 5.8. <hi>Chriſi died</hi> (for) <hi>us;</hi> that is, we have an <hi>intereſt</hi> in his death, we enjoy the benefit of his death, we are juſtified by his death, as the words following do declare. Againe, 2 Cor. 12.9. <hi>my grace is ſufficient</hi> (for) <hi>thee:</hi> that is, my grace is thine, it is thy portion, thou haſt an <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> in it, I will give it to thee for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98399:24"/>thy ſtrength, and help in time of need. So alſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.51. <hi>The bread that I will give is my fleſh, which I will give</hi> (for) <hi>the life of the world:</hi> that is, the world hath an <hi>intereſt</hi> and <hi>propriety</hi> in it, the world ſhall certainly live by it. And leaſt I ſhould be thought by ſome te peake this without ground, I deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re them to conſider, what he ſaith above in verſe 33. <hi>The bread of God is he that commeth downe from beaven, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth life (to) the world.</hi> That which he ſaith in 51. <hi>is (for) the like of the world:</hi> he ſaith in this verſe, it giveth life <hi>(to)</hi> the world. I deſire that this may be well minded; And it will ſerve, to diſcover the unwarrantable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that deſtinction, which ſome make, who ſay; That Chriſt gave himſelfe to be life <hi>for</hi> all, but not to all. But certainly, to be <hi>(for)</hi> all, and <hi>(to)</hi> all, is the ſame in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Chriſt. Theſe inſtances are ſufficient (though many more might be added) to cleare the thing in hand. Wherefore, I conclude that when he ſaith in this place we have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98399:24"/>now in hand, died (for) <hi>all:</hi> we are to underſtand, that the <hi>benefit, riches,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of his death, and reſurrection is certainly theirs, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them for life and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now how theſe things will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to <hi>All perſons,</hi> I leave to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to judge.</p>
            <p>And having thus far cleared the words,
<note place="margin">The true meaning of theſe words.</note> I ſhall come in the ſecond place to declare the true and proper meaning of them. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we are to conſider, that this word <hi>[All]</hi> is diverſly taken in Scripture, according to the divers, or various matters ſpoken of.

And this I ſhall prove both to be agreeable to this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in hand; as alſo that the word <hi>[All]</hi> is ſo to be underſtood in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Scriptures of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is agreeable to this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in hand: The which thing I ſhal prove from two conſiderations in

And this, no doubt, we are to underſtand to be ſpoken eſpecially concerning the Jewes, who did much glory in <hi>appearances;</hi> that is, in outward and fleſhly <hi>priviledges.</hi> Their boaſting was, That they were Jewes by nature, they were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> children, they were circumciſed ones, they alone were partakers of many excellent <hi>priviledges.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it was ordinary with them to glory in theſe <hi>appearances,</hi> fair ſhews, outward and fleſhly <hi>priviledges.</hi> Yea, ſo much they did boaſt in them, as that they accounted <hi>all</hi> people and nations, but themſelves, forlorn and wretched. And the preaching of ſalvation by Chriſt to the Gentiles, was a thing which they much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and ſtumbled at. And this I conceive to be the reaſon of that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in verſe 13. <hi>Whether we be beſides our ſelves, it is to God.</hi> Thoſe who gloried ſo much in <hi>appearances,</hi> they
<pb facs="tcp:98399:25"/>acounted the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, who preached Jeſus Chriſt, and ſalvation through him to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, to be mad men, <hi>men beſides themſelves:</hi> But, ſaith he, <hi>What we doe,</hi> it is to God: <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us: becauſe wee thus judge, that Chriſt died for All,</hi> that is, Let them not marvell why we preach Jeſus Chriſt, and the word of reconciliation to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Gentiles: Let them know that we have good reaſon for it,
<note place="margin">A twofold myſtery in the words.</note> 
               <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we thus judge, that Chriſt died for all</hi> Nations, not of the Jewes onely but of the Gentiles alſo. And in the words thus conſidered, there is a twofold heavenly myſtery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is no way to life and ſalvation for any people, but through Jeſus Chriſt onely.</p>
            <p>It is not their circumciſion, nor being the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor their enjoyment of any outward <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi> though never ſo excellent, that can commend any to God; It is not theſe <hi>appearances</hi> that gives
<pb facs="tcp:98399:26"/>men an intereſt in God, or makes them to live in the ſight of God. For, faith he, <hi>All are dead:</hi> not the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles onely, who had no <hi>privileges,</hi> but the Jewes alſo who had many <hi>priviledges.</hi> There is no <hi>betterneſſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in the one then the other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. And there is but one way to life and glory both for Jewes and Gentiles; to wit, by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who died and roſe again.</hi> And this was now to take away all glorying in the fleſh, in <hi>appearance,</hi> in outward <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi> or in any other thing: That as it is written, <hi>He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond myſteſy in the words is this, <hi>to wit,</hi> that Chriſt died for <hi>All;</hi> that is, for <hi>all</hi> nations, or <hi>all</hi> kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of people: not of the Jewes onely, who had many outward <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi> but of the Gentiles alſo, who had nothing at all to glory in: that ſo the freeneſſe and riches of the grace of God, might (through the death of Chriſt) be exceedingly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified unto them alſo: that ſo <hi>all</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world might enjoy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98399:26"/>life and ſalvation through the death of Chriſt. This is the grace of God given to the Gentiles, which hee ſpeakes of in the next chapter, and exhorts them to walk worthy of that ſo that miniſtery of reconcilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which God had committed to him, and others to preach amongſt them, and which God had made ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o them, in bringing them to Chriſt, might in no wiſe be blamed. And thus now, they had ſomething to anſwer them which gloried in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that is, in outward and fleſhly priviledges, and not in heart. And thus much concerning the firſt conſideration from the words, to prove that the word <hi>(All)</hi> in this place we are to underſtand (as the proper meaning of it) <hi>All Nations,</hi> or kindreds of people, not Jewes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but Gentiles alſo.</p>
            <p>The ſecond conſideration is from thoſe words in verſe 16. <hi>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the fleſh:</hi> that is, time was, when we knew, or acknowledged men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to outward or fleſhly <hi>priviledges:</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:98399:27"/>and God did ſo require it. Time was when we ſet a high eſteeme upon the Circumciſion, the Jewes onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were diſtinguiſhed from all others by many excellent out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>priviledges:</hi> But Now Jeſus Chriſt by his death hath taken away that difference, which was between them and others. He was manifeſted for <hi>All,</hi> he died for <hi>All,</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to any ſuch differences, as was once between Jew and Gentile; Therefore <hi>henceforth,</hi> or from this Time we make no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one and other: we know no man according to any outward or fleſhly <hi>priviledge:</hi> For Chriſt hath laid down his life, as well for the Gentiles as the Jewes, whereby all ſuch difference is Now taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And thus from theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. I conclude, that by the word <hi>(All)</hi> in this place, we are to underſtand <hi>All nations</hi> of men, or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of people, in way of oppoſition to one nation or people onely. All nations had now, not before (in point
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98399:27"/>of execution) a doore of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation opened to them by the death of Chriſt. And indeed there is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious myſtery held forth to us under this conſideration of the word <hi>All, to wit,</hi> That the grace of God was more abundantly enlarged or ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth by the manifeſtation and death of Chriſt, then before.</p>
            <p>The grace of God was now exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded farre and wide vnto all Nations and kindreds of people: It was now without bounds and limits, enlargnig it ſelfe vnto the ends of the Earth, without making any difference be tweene Iew and Gentile. Vntill then it was limitted or bounded unto the Iewiſh Nation onely; I ſay, the grace of God, and the way of Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was bound vp within that compaſſe or corner onely: and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations were without Chriſt and without God in the World: But in due time by the manifeſtation and death of Chriſt, the grace of God was extended to all Nations without any difference. This I conceive is that which the holy Spirit teacheth in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98399:28"/>ſecond verſe of the next Chapter (as an accompliſhment of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in Eſa 49.8. <hi>I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation have I ſuccoured thee: behold now is the accepted time: behold, now is the day of Salvation:</hi> that is, now that the Son of God hath appeared in the fleſh, and ſuffered death upon the Croſſe for the ſinnes of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and now that the word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is to bee preached or declared to all Nations: Now is the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation. And he uſhereth in each expreſſion with a note of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and admiration: <hi>Behold now, Behold now.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, mind it well, and wonder at it: <hi>Now</hi> there is a door of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation opened to all Nations of the World. And this indeed is a miſery which the Scripture much ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, which if it be well minded and conſidered, is of great uſe, both to diſcover the unſoundneſſe of that opinion of Chriſts dying for all perſons, as alſo to give much light
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98399:28"/>to the underſtanding of many other Scriptures, wherein we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>All</hi> to be meant of <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or <hi>Kindreds</hi> of People, and not of <hi>Perſons.</hi> I will mention a few Scriptures for many, Pſalm. 22.27. and 67.2, 3, 4, 7. and 72.11, 17. and 117.1. Eſa 45.22. and 52.10. and 56.7. Luke 2.10, 30.31. and 3.5, 6. John 1.7. and 12.32 33. Epheſ 3.9. Titus 2.11. In theſe Scriptures, and in many others, we have this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry held forth to us, both by way of prophecie and performance: <hi>to wit,</hi> That the grace of God by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation and death of Chriſt <hi>(and not before)</hi> is extended farre, and wide to all Nations of the World.</p>
            <p>Untill then, it was limited and bounded by himſelfe into a little corner: but then it was enlarged unto all the ends of the Earth. The underſtanding Reader will weigh things together. And thus I have (through the Lords helpe) both cleared this Scripture from that corrupt ſenſe, and declared the true and naturall meaning therof; being
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98399:29"/>perſwaded that what I have ſaid herein is the mind of Chriſt, being no wayes croſſing either to the ſcope of the place it ſelfe, or to any other Scripture.</p>
            <p>Another Scripture propounded by them to juſtifie their opinion is that in Heb.
<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Scripture.</note> 2.9. The words are theſe following. <hi>But we ſee Ieſus, who was made a little lower then the Angels, through the ſuffering of death, crowned with glory and honour, that he by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man.</hi> The laſt clauſe of the verſe <hi>(that he by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for every man)</hi> is that which they pitch upon to maintaine Chriſts dying or ſuffering for the ſins of all perſons, even of every man.</p>
            <p>Before I come to declare the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Scripture, it is ſomthing needfull to cleare the tranſlation it ſelfe. In our tranſlation the words are rendred, that he by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for every man. But in the Greek they run thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ut gratia dei pro omnibus non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omni,

               </gap> per omnia. guſtaret mortem, <hi>that he by the grace of God ſhould taste death for all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now before I cloſe with the words themſelves,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.6.</note> I ſhall firſt ſhew that this word <hi>(all)</hi> or <hi>(every)</hi> in Scripture is not alwayes taken gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for all perſons in the world, but ſomtimes it is to bee underſtood with a limitation, according to the matter ſpoken of in each Scripture. I will give a few inſtances for many, Acts 2.44.45. <hi>They that believed ſold their poſſeſſions and goods, and parted them to (all) men, as (every) man had need.</hi> And in chapter 4.45. <hi>Diſtribution was made to (every) man, according as he had neede:</hi> that is, to <hi>all</hi> or <hi>every</hi> one of the Diſciples to <hi>all</hi> believers, to all that were of the Church, who had need of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Againe, Acts 4.21. <hi>All men glorified God for that which was done:</hi> that is, <hi>All</hi> men in thoſe parts, <hi>All</hi> men that knew of it, all them that dwelt in Jeruſalem, as is expreſſed in the 16. verſe of the ſame chapter. Againe, Luke 16.16. <hi>The Kingdome
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98399:30"/>of God is preached, and (every) man preſſeth into it:</hi> that is, <hi>every</hi> man in whoſe heart the Lord ſtirreth up a holy violence, <hi>every violent man,</hi> as Matthew expreſſeth it, chapt. 11. verſe 12. So alſo, Heb. 8.11. <hi>All ſhall know me from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> The judicious Reader will eaſily ſee, that although the word <hi>(all)</hi> or <hi>(every)</hi> be expreſſed very generally in theſe Scriptures, yet it is to be underſtoode with a limitation (as in many other Scriptures alſo) according to the matter which each Scripture ſpeakes of.</p>
            <p>Having promiſed this caution, I will now cloſe with the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And before I declare, what I conceive to be the meaning of them,
<note place="margin">the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words by ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> I will propound ſome reaſons, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing why we cannot underſtand them according to their ſenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I do not reade any where in Scripture that the death of Chriſt is called a taſting of death: but ſufferings, bruiſings, woundings oppreſſings, travellings of his ſoule and the like.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98399:30"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> If we take the word <hi>(taſting)</hi> in this place for <hi>ſuffering;</hi> then (as I conceive) there will be a needleſſe repetition, and much harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the words: for then they will run thus, to wit, <hi>we ſee Ieſus, through the ſuffering of death, crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with glory and honour, that he by the grace of God ſhould</hi> ſuffer <hi>death:</hi> minde now, He <hi>ſuffered</hi> death, that he ſhould <hi>ſuffer</hi> death; would not here be a needleſſe repetition and much harſhneſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> If we take the word <hi>(taſting)</hi> in this place for ſuffering of death: then (as I conceive) it will follow, that Chriſt underwent a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>ſuffering</hi> of death; to wit, a <hi>ſuffering</hi> of death, after he is crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with glory and honour, through that one and bitter ſuffering of death upon the croſſe; For the words run thus, <hi>we ſee him through the ſuffering of death, crowned with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that he ſhould taſte death.</hi> If therefore by the <hi>taſting</hi> of death, in this place, we underſtand his <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of death, then it followes that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98399:31"/>he <hi>ſuffers</hi> death after he is crowned with glory and honour, and this is ſo aſſur'd, and falſe that every one will reject it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> to come now to the true, and naturall meaning of theſe words, (I conceive) By his <hi>taſting</hi> death, we are not to underſtand, his <hi>ſuffering</hi> of death, but an effect or fruit of his ſuffering of death, and being crowned with glory: And then, we are to underſtand the words <hi>(taſting death)</hi> to be a <hi>ſweetning</hi> or <hi>reliſhing</hi> of death, a makeing of death <hi>taſtefull, ſavorie, ſweet, uſefull,</hi> and <hi>gaynefull.</hi> He <hi>tasted</hi> death, that is, he made it <hi>taſtefull, ſweet,</hi> and <hi>ſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> And ſo I ſay, it is an effect of his ſuffering of death, and being crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with glory: that is, He through his ſuffering of death, being crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with glory, hath according to the grace of God made death <hi>taſtefull,

For, or unto all theſe, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of theſe, he by his ſufferings &amp; glory, hath made death taſtefull &amp; ſavory: he hath ſweetned death, and made it an entrance or paſſage unto glory for them all: that as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their Salvation was made perſect through ſufferings: ſo every one of them ſhall bee made perfect through ſufferings alſo. This (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) is the true and naturall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Scripture; and I am ſure it is agreeable to other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. And therefore death unto every one of Chriſts Brethren, or Children, is but a ſleep, a reſt, and a paſſing over (as it were) unto a more glorious condition, which they ſhall enjoy with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in the morning of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>A third Scripture propounded by them to juſtifie their opinion,

            </p>
            <p>In which words (as I conceive) is held forth to us eſpecially in four things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the man Chriſt Jeſus gave himſelf unto death: for ſo we are to underſtand that expreſſion, <hi>he gave himſelf:</hi> that is, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto death, he gave his life, he laid down his life. And ſo it agreeth with the words of Chriſt in Matth. 20.28 and Mark 10.45. <hi>The Son of man came to give his life a ranſome.</hi> And this teacheth us the voluntary readineſſe of Jeſus Chriſt in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf freely to ſuffer death; According to what he witneſſeth of himſelf, Iohn 10.18 <hi>No man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> (as following upon the former) The end and power of his death; and that is expreſly declared in theſe words, <hi>He gave himſelfe a ranſome for all.</hi> The death of Chriſt is of a <hi>ranſoming, redeeming, ſaving</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:98399:32"/>power. This is the power of it, and this is the end of it.</p>

<note place="margin">The words cleared by ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> That we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it according to their ſence, I ſhall prove from three or four rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the words themſelves, and thoſe depending upon them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> reaſon is taken from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:98399:33"/>the conſideration of the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of the death of Chriſt, the death of Chriſt is of a <hi>ranſoming, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming, ſaveing</hi> power: This is the <hi>power</hi> of it, and this is the <hi>end</hi> of it. Thus he ſaith himſelfe, of himſelfe, Mat. 20.28. <hi>The Sonne of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſome for many.</hi> Thoſe for whom Chriſt died, hee ranſometh them from the power of Sathan to God, from death to life, from captivity to liberty, from darkneſſe to light, from ſinne to grace by the power of his death. So he ſaith by <hi>Peter, Ye know that ye were not redeemed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pet. 1.8.19.</note> or ranſomed <hi>with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orruptible things; but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lambe without blemiſh and without ſpot.</hi> And ſo it is ſaid, Heb. 9.12. <hi>By the ſhedding of his own blood, he hath obtained eternall redemption.</hi> This is the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of the ſhedding of his bloud. And ſo hee ſaith alſo in the 15. verſe, <hi>That by meanes of death for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions under the firſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:98399:33"/>that is, This is the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of his death, to ranſome and redeeme us from the tranſgreſſions which the firſt Teſtament could not redeem us from. Now if this be the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>power of his death, to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, redeeme,</hi> or <hi>ſave:</hi> &amp; if all thoſe for whom he died, be <hi>ranſomed, redeemed,</hi> and <hi>ſaved</hi> by the power of his death: then by the word <hi>(all)</hi> in this place we cannot underſtand all perſons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> reaſon is taken from the conſideration of the nature and force of the word <hi>(for)</hi> in this place. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It ſignifieth in this place <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> or <hi>propriety,</hi> and carrieth the force of an application in it, <hi>He gaue himſelf a ranſome for all,</hi> that is, He gave himſelfe to death for the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> of <hi>all;</hi> that is, <hi>All</hi> ſhall be certainly <hi>ranſomed, redeemed,</hi> and <hi>ſaved</hi> by the power of his death. In Matth. 20.28. Chriſt ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>The Son of Man came to give his life a ranſome (for) many.</hi> And Chapter 26.28. <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſtament which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98399:34"/>is ſhed (for) many for the remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> And Luke 22.20. He ſaith, <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament in my blood which is ſhed (for) you.</hi> Who will not acknowledge with me, that the word <hi>for</hi> in theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſignifieth <hi>intereſt</hi> and <hi>proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and carrieth the force of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and communication in it? that is, Many ſhall certainly, and powerfully, &amp; perfectly be <hi>ranſomed</hi> by the power of my death. Many ſhall certainly and perfectly enjoy <hi>remiſſion</hi> of all their ſins, by the ſhedding of my blood for them. So in this place when he ſaith, <hi>He gave himſelfe a ranſome (for) all:</hi> It ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, <hi>All</hi> ſhall be certainly <hi>ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed, redeemed,</hi> and <hi>ſaved</hi> by the power of his death. And therefore, this cannot agree to all perſons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> reaſon is taken from the mediation of Chriſt: Thoſe for whom Chriſt is the ranſome, he is for them the Mediator alſo. This is manifeſt from the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe words with the former. <hi>There is one Mediatour betweene
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98399:34"/>God and men, the man Chriſt Ieſus, who gave himſelfe a ranſome for all.</hi> Whence it is evident, that for whomſoever Chriſt is a ranſome, he is for them a Mediatour alſo. And indeed his Mediatourſhip de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth, yea inſeperably dependeth upon his giving himſelfe to be a ranſome: as is manifeſt Heb. 9.15. Now the efficacie of his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is to apply unto the hearts and mindes of all thoſe for whom he ſhed his blood, all the grace, bleſſings and promiſes of the new Covenant. (for of that he is the Mediatour.) He writes his lawes in their hearts, calles them to God, makes them his people, gives them remiſſion of ſins, and the promiſe of an eternall inheritance. Heb 8.6.10.11.12. and 9.14.15. Thus the Mediatourſhip and ranſome do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in one, and inſeperably de de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on each other. And therefore this cannot agree to all perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe the word <hi>(all)</hi> in the 4. verſe (which hath its dependance upon the 5. and 6.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98399:35"/>verſes) cannot be underſtood to be ſpoken concerning all perſons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> The words are theſe following <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Theſe words are rendred <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,</hi> He <hi>will</hi> have <hi>all</hi> men to be ſaved. It is not ſaid, All men <hi>may</hi> or <hi>might</hi> be ſaved, but he <hi>will</hi> have all men to be ſaved. Now the <hi>will</hi> of God is <hi>free, abſolute, powerfull, righteous</hi> and <hi>unchangeable;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth <hi>will,</hi> he performes allwayes with full power. Whence I conclude, that if by <hi>(all men)</hi> in this place we underſtand <hi>(all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)</hi> then it will follow that <hi>all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> ſhall certainly, powerfully, and undoubted be ſaved, becauſe God doth ſo <hi>will it.</hi> But this is unagreeable to the word of truth. Therefore as by <hi>(all men)</hi> in this 4. verſe, we cannot underſtand <hi>(all perſons)</hi> neither ſo can we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the word <hi>all</hi> in verſe 6. for they depend <hi>ſweetly</hi> and <hi>inſeparably</hi> upon one another. But we are to underſtand it in both places under
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98399:35"/>another conſideration,
<note place="margin">The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Scripture. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe that the ſame thing which by Mark. 13.13. and Luke 21.17. is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred All men, is by Mat. 24.9. rendred All nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; this explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe.</note> according to the matter in hand: that is, by <hi>(all)</hi> in theſe places, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>all degrees</hi> of men, but chiefly <hi>all nations</hi> or <hi>kindreds</hi> of men, not of the <hi>Iewes</hi> onely, but of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo. According to what is written, <hi>Is he the God of the Iewes onely? is he not alſo of the Gentiles? yes of the Gentiles alſo.</hi> Rom. 3.29. This interpretation of this place, as it is agreeable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures: ſo to this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe alſo. The which thing is evident from the 7. verſe of this chapter: for when it is ſaid in the 6. verſe. <hi>He gave himſelfe a ranſome for all: he ſaith</hi> in the next words, <hi>Whereunto I am appointed a Preacher and an Apoſtle, a Teacher of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in faith and verity.</hi> The grace of God by the death of Chriſt, or by the giving of himſelfe to be a ranſome was now, or at this time magnified and manifeſted unto all nations of the world: and now God appointed or commanded his Servants to declare remiſſion of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98399:36"/>ſins and everlaſting life to all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world through faith in Chriſt. And hence it is, that the giving of himſelfe a ranſome for all, is ſaid to be, <hi>a Teſtimony in due time.</hi> There was a time or ſeaſon which God appointed and promiſed for the magnifying and manifeſting the exceeding riches of his grace and love in Chriſt Ieſus unto all nations of the world.
<note place="margin">Gen. 12.3. &amp; 18.18. &amp; 22.18.</note> This time or ſeaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n was the manifeſtation and ſuffering of Chriſt in the fleſh: for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>He gave himſelfe,</hi> that is, he gave his own life unto death. At which time (which is the due time here ſpoken of) he was a <hi>teſtimony,</hi> or a <hi>witneſſe</hi> (for ſo he is called in Scripture) of the rich mercy and grace of God,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 55.4.</note> which was formerly promiſed to all nations of the world, and propheſied of in the Scriptures of the Prophets: to wit, <hi>That the Nations of the Gentiles</hi> (a people which he neither formerly knew, neither did they know him) <hi>ſhould be called and redeemed by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> Hither to alſo (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98399:36"/>agreeth that in Matth. 26.28. <hi>The ſonne of man came to give</hi> his life a ran ſome <hi>for many,</hi> and 26.28. <hi>This is my blood of the new Teſtament which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Vntill Chriſt gave his own life and ſhed his own blood, there was but a (few) ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed or redeemed, even a few (as it were) out of one nation or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world, a few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of after times: But when he gave himſelfe, laid downe his own life, ſhed his own blood, the end and power of this was, to ranſome or redeeme or ſave many, even ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out of all nations and kindreds of the world, <hi>many</hi> in compariſon of former times. This was the end and power and fruit of his owne death, and the ſhedding of his own blood, even the redemption and ſalvation of many, I ſay <hi>many</hi> out of all nations of the world, many in compariſon of former times. And thus theſe Scriptures do ſweetly agree together.</p>
            <p>This that I have ſaid, (I conceive)
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98399:37"/>is the true and naturall meaning of this Scripture, as if the Apoſtle ſhould thus have ſaid, <hi>God our Saviour will have all Nations of men to be ſaved through the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt: for there is one Mediatour betweene God and men the man Chriſt Ieſus, who gaue his life a ranſome for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all nations of the World, to be a teſtimony of the exceeding grace of God (formerly promiſed) by Ieſus Chriſt: Whereunto I am appointed a Preacher and an Apoſtle, a teacher of the Gentiles, that they ſhould know and enjoy the benefit of this myſtery, which hath heene hidden from former ages and generations.</hi> And this is directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with that which is written, Rom. 16.25.26. where he ſaith, <hi>That the preaching of Ieſus Chriſt is now, according to the Commandement of the everlaſting God made knowne to all Nations for the obedience of Faith.</hi> Marke it, It is (now) made manifeſt to (all Nations) for the obedience of Faith. Thus (as J conceive) I have layd open the mind of God in this Scripture, whereby I have cleared it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98399:37"/>from that corrupt ſence which they put upon it;</p>
            <p>A fourth Scripture propounded by them is Eſaias 53.6.
<note place="margin">The 4th. Scripture.</note> 
               <hi>All wee like Sheepe have gone aſtray: we have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every one to his owne way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of vs all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>(All)</hi> in this Scripture they vnderſtand all perſons from firſt to laſt. I ſhall from the words themſelves clearely prove that we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the word <hi>(All)</hi> in this place vnder another conſideration accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>It is to be minded that the word <hi>(All)</hi> in this Scripture is conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>(We)</hi> and <hi>(Vs) All we, All Vs, All we have gone aſtray, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi> That is, he hath laid on him the iniquity <hi>of all we, or all us,</hi> who doe enjoy peace with God through him, and are healed by him; as it is plainly expreſſed in the words before going; <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> that is; We are healed of our
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98399:38"/>backſlidings, of our goings aſtray, of our turnings away from God: We are now returned unto the Lord, and doe enjoy peace with him through Ieſus Chriſt. And thus Peter inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets the word healing, 1 Pet. 2.24.25. <hi>By whoſe ſtripes ye were healed, for ye were as ſheepe going aſtray, but are now returned unto the Shepheard and Biſhop of your ſouls,</hi> He makes <hi>healing,</hi> and <hi>returning</hi> unto Chriſt to be both one. <hi>Ye are healed by his ſtripes,</hi> that is, ye are enabled by the power of the death of Chriſt to returne unto him. Theſe things are without doubt a ſure fruit of Chriſts <hi>woundings, bruiſings, ſtripes</hi> and <hi>chaſtiſements</hi> for our ſins, to wit our peace with God through him, and healing by him. And this is moſt ſweetly in a Propheticall way ſet forth by the Prophet Hoſea, 6.1.2. <hi>Come let us returne unto the Lord, for he hath torne, and he will heale us; he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe words are certainely a prophecie of the death and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ieſus Chriſt, wherein is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he was <hi>torne,</hi> and <hi>ſmitten</hi> for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98399:38"/>our ſinnes, that we might vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and powerfully receive <hi>healing</hi> and <hi>binding</hi> up by him. And therefore the words are ſet downe by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>He will heale us, and he will bind us up.</hi> And this grace of his to us, is the very ground and cauſe of our returning to him: for ſo the words are to be vnderſtood, <hi>Come and let us returne to the Lord, for he will heale us, and he will binde us up,</hi> We may no thinke that our retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Lord is the cauſe of our healing: but our being healed and bound up by the wounds of Chriſt for us, is the cauſe of our returning to God. Yea, our returning to the Lord is no other thing but our being hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the ſtripes of Chriſt. From what hath beene ſaid, it is cleare, that all thoſe for whom Chriſt was brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, wounded and chaſtiſed, are ſuch who are in time healed by him, and doe enjoy peace with God through him: for his ſtripes doe powerfully bring forth healing; that is repentance or turning to the Lord, unto all thoſe for whom he did beare the ſame. The
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98399:39"/>very end and power of the ſufferings of Chriſt for us, is to bring us to God, 1 Pet. 3.18. O how full of <hi>power, life, vertue</hi> and <hi>healing,</hi> are the <hi>ſtripes</hi> of Chriſt! There was never a <hi>ſtripe</hi> of Chriſt but is of a <hi>healing</hi> nature, Now how thoſe things will agree to <hi>all perſons,</hi> (as they would have it) I leave to the conſideration of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Reader.</p>
            <p>Another thing I deſire to obſerve from the words, to wit, whereas E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaias ſaith, <hi>God hath laid on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of us all:</hi> Peter ſpeaking of the ſame place ſaith, <hi>He bare our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> both which have indeed one meaning, the latter explaining the former. And truely the words are of great force, <hi>He (bare) our iniquities,</hi> he did not ſhrinke or faint under them, or beare them to the halves, but he <hi>bare them:</hi> that is, he <hi>bare</hi> them <hi>ſtrongly, fully, powerfully</hi> vntill the worke was done, vntill he was a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour</hi> over them all in our behalfe, that we might be enabled to die to ſinne and live to righteouſneſſe. This is indeed the fruit of Chriſts power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98399:39"/>bearing of our ſinnes, as the holy Spirit witneſſeth, 1 Pet. 2.24.25. Now how theſe things can agree to <hi>all perſons</hi> let the vnderſtanding Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge.</p>
            <p>I doe therefore conclude as before, that by <hi>(all)</hi> in this Scripture, we are to vnderſtand <hi>all we, all us,</hi> that is, <hi>all we who doe enjoy peace with God through him, all us who are healed by him,</hi> And thus the word <hi>all,</hi> is to be vnderſtood in Rom. 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his owne Sonne but delivered him up to death for us all,</hi> marke it, <hi>for us all;</hi> that is, <hi>us all who are called by him, and juſtified by him,</hi> as the two former verſes doe clearly teach. And thus the word <hi>(all)</hi> is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood (although vpon another occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) in Gal. 4.26. <hi>Ieraſalem which is above is free, which is the Mother of us all,</hi> that is, <hi>us all</hi> who are the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> of God, believers in Ieſus Chriſt. Thus much for the opening of that Scripture.</p>
            <p>A fifth Scripture propounded by them to Iuſtifie their opinion,
<note place="margin">The fifth Scripture</note> is that in Iohn 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lambe of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98399:40"/>God which taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that I may (as the Lord hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth me) diſcover the mind of God in this Scripture, and cleare it from that corrupt ſence which they put upon it: I will firſt ſhew in what ſeverall reſpects or acceptations the word <hi>(World)</hi> is taken in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe herein lyeth the chiefe difference between us: and then make application to the thing in hand.</p>
            <p>The divers acceptations in which the word <hi>(World)</hi> is taken in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I conceive may be all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under theſe following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> ſomtimes it is taken, &amp; that very often, for <hi>that round compaſſe of the Earth with the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, eſpecially mankind,</hi> which God created and faſhioned in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and hath renewed and governed from time to time. Pſal. 24.1. and 50.12. Into this <hi>World</hi> Chriſt came, and out of this <hi>world</hi> (after he done the will of his Father) hee aſcended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to ſit at the right hand of his Father.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:98399:40"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The word World is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken for <hi>a part of the World</hi> onely, and yet in a generall tearm is called the <hi>World,</hi> Iohn 12.19. Acts 19.27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is ſometimes taken, and that but ſeldome in the Scripture, but oftentimes in our ordinary ſpeech, for <hi>a great number or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of any thing.</hi> Iames 3.6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is ſometimes taken, and that very often in Scripture, for <hi>the fading joyes, pleaſures, riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and liberties which are here below:</hi> as alſo, <hi>for ſinfull cuſtomes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill manners, ungodly workes, worldly doctrines, and luſts:</hi> as they ſtand in oppoſition to thoſe joyes, riches, and honours, which are above: and thoſe wayes, workes and doctrines which are according to the will of God, Rom. 12.2. Gal. 6.14. Iames 1. laſt, 1 Ioh. 2.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is ſometimes taken <hi>for worldly or ungodly men,</hi> as they ſtand in oppoſition to holy and godly men, the called and beloved ones of God, Mat. 18.7. Iohn 15.18, 19. and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98399:41"/>17 9, 14, 16. 1 Iohn 3 13. Rev. 11.9. and 13.3. compared with verſ. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The word world is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken <hi>for the Nation of the Gentiles,</hi> who in Scripture are called the <hi>world in way of oppoſition to the Icwiſh Nation,</hi> who alone were the Church of God, untill the wall of partition was broken down by the death of Chriſt. This is cleare from what is written in Rom. 11.12. <hi>If the fall of them</hi> (that is of the Iewes) <hi>be the riches of the world, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing of them the riches of the Gentiles,</hi> And again, verſ. 15. <hi>If the caſting away of them be the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the world.</hi> In this Scripture it is moſt evident, that the Nation of the Gentiles are called the <hi>world,</hi> as ſtanding in oppoſition to the Iewiſh Church. And thus alſo we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words of Chriſt in Iohn 17.21, 23. where he prayeth, <hi>That the world may beleeve that the Father ſent him, and that the Father loved them, as he loved him.</hi> And in Luke 12.30. compared with Matth. 6.32. It is manifeſt, That the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98399:41"/>are called the Nations of the <hi>world.</hi> Thus much alſo the Apoſtle teacheth in Epheſ. 2.11.12. <hi>In time paſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye were Gentiles in the fleſh, called the uncircumciſion,</hi> in way of oppoſition <hi>to that which is called the circumciſion in the fleſh, made by hands. And at that time,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenants of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world.</hi> Doth not he here teach ſo much, That there was a time when the Gentiles were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>world,</hi> or the <hi>uncircumciſion,</hi> in way of oppoſition to the <hi>Iewiſh Church,</hi> who were called the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> of the fleſh, and enjoyed many great and glorious priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The word world is ſometimes taken <hi>for all Nations of people, Iewes, and Gentiles,</hi> as ſtanding in way of oppoſition to one nation of people only, Mat. 24.14. Mark 14 9. and 16.15.</p>

               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> it is ſomtimes taken <hi>for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98399:42"/>the world to come,</hi> in way of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this preſent world, Epheſ. 1.21. Heb. 2.5. and 6.5.</p>
            <p>And having thus farre made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the matter, I will now proceed to the conſideration of the Scripture in hand, Ioh. 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God which taketh away the ſinne of the world.</hi> By <hi>(world)</hi> here they underſtand <hi>all perſons, or all men and women from firſt to laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come to give the true, and naturall meaning of this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, I ſhall firſt ſhew one or two Reaſons from the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to cleere them from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſence which they put upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt reaſon</hi> is taken from the conſideration of theſe words <hi>(ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away) He (taketh away) the ſiune of the world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> The words are exceeding cleere, and full, and of great force. He doth not ſay, It is probable, or it is poſſible, <hi>he may take them away:</hi> but <hi>he taketh them away;</hi> that is, He <hi>certainly, fully, freely, perfectly, powerfully,</hi> and <hi>for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98399:42"/>ever taketh them away.</hi> And I am confident that the words <hi>take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, taken away, and taketh away,</hi> when they are ſpoken of things done, or to be done, do alwayes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie in Scripture a <hi>perfect powerful, abſolute,</hi> and <hi>compleat removall</hi> or <hi>taking away</hi> of things: ſo that the things do not remain any more. I could give many Scriptures to prove this: but I will content my ſelf with a few, which I deſire may be well noted, Eſa 6.7. <hi>Thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is taken away,</hi> Rom. 11.27. <hi>This is my Covenant with them when I ſhall take away their ſinnes,</hi> Heb. 10.9. <hi>He taketh away the firſt, that he may establiſh the ſecond,</hi> 1 Ioh. 3.5. <hi>And ye know that he was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to take away our ſins.</hi> So that in the Scripture Language <hi>to take away</hi> a thing, it is <hi>powerfully, throughly, perfectly,</hi> and <hi>for ever to take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> ſo to remove it as that it come not into remembrance any more. And therfore the reaſon why there was a remembrance of ſins once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year under the ſacrifices of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98399:43"/>Law, was becauſe thoſe ſacrifice, could not <hi>take away ſinne,</hi> Heb. 10.3, 4. Implying, that if their ſins had been <hi>taken away</hi> by thoſe Sacrifices then they ſhould never have beene remembred any more. Therefore I conclude, that when Iohn ſaith of the Lambe of God, <hi>he takeh away ſins;</hi> wee are to underſtand, He ſo removeth them, <hi>or taketh them away</hi> as makes to the <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of thoſe from whom hee <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them away:</hi> ſo as they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come into remembrance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them any more. Agreeable to that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 103.12. <hi>As far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt: ſo far he removeth or taketh away our tranſgreſſions from us.</hi> And this will be further manifeſt, if we conſider what it is to <hi>take away ſin.</hi> Now to take away ſinne, in the Scripture ſence, is to take away the <hi>merit, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, power, dominion, Lordſhip,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> of ſinne: ſo as neither the one or the other ſhall ever returne again any more. And therfore when it is ſaid, Rom. 11.27. <hi>This is my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98399:43"/>with them, when I ſhall take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>way their ſins:</hi> He ſaith in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe, <hi>There ſhall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and ſhall turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ungodlineſſe from Iacob.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this is the office and power of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his Deliverer, <hi>to take away ſins and ungodlineſſe in all reſpects;</hi> not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n reſpect of <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>wages,</hi> but of <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>Lordſhip</hi> alſo. So that ſuch who have their ſins <hi>taken away,</hi> they have the <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>wages</hi> of their ſinnes <hi>taken away:</hi> they have their <hi>ungodlineſſe, diſobedience, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And therefore repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes alwayes goes together in Scripture, either expreſſed or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. Neither do I read that the ſins of any are ſaid to be <hi>remitted,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And if any ſhall make ſcruple at the word <hi>ſinne,</hi> becauſe it is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed <hi>Sinne</hi> (in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) and not <hi>Sinnes:</hi> Let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that it is uſuall in the Scripture indifferently to put the one for the other: as is evident by comparing

               <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.6. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24.

That which <hi>Eſaias</hi> calleth <hi>tranſgreſſion, Paul</hi> calleth <hi>tranſgreſſions.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>John</hi> expreſſe it here in the ſingular number, yet is it moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that under this word <hi>ſinne,</hi> hee includeth <hi>all ſius</hi> of all degrees and all times.</p>
            <p>Now from all that I have ſaid, we are thus to underſtand the words.</p>
            <p>The Lamb of God by the <hi>price</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of his blood-ſhed, doth <hi>perfectly, powerfully,</hi> and <hi>for ever, take away</hi> the ſinnes of the <hi>world.</hi> Now how this doth agree to <hi>all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> or <hi>to every man in the world,</hi> I leave to the conſideration of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Reader, who I doubt not, will weigh theſe things together which I have declared, for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this Scripture from that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſenſe which they put upon it.</p>

And why ſhould we wrangle with God, or queſtion the wiſdome

            </p>
            <p>A ſixt Scripture propounded by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, <hi>John</hi> 3.16.17.
<note place="margin">The ſixth Scripture.</note> 
               <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onlybegotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſon: that whoſoever beleeveth on him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. For God ſent not his Son into the world to condemne the world, but that the world through him might bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> The greateſt difficulty in this Scripture lieth alſo in the word <hi>World.</hi> They ſay we are here to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>all perſons,</hi> or <hi>all men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to which (before I come to give the natural meaning of this Seripture) I ſhall give two or three reaſons from the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, compared with other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to cleare them from that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſence which they put upon them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is here ſaid, <hi>God ſo loved the world. He loved the world:</hi> yea, <hi>he ſo loved the world.</hi> Now I doe not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98399:48"/>finde any where in Scripture, That God is ſaid <hi>to love</hi> any, and <hi>ſo to love</hi> them, but we are to underſtand it to be ſpoken of his <hi>everlaſting, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, quickening, drawing, ſaving love</hi> in his Sonne. I finde the Scripture plainly ſpeaking to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9. <hi>In this was manifeſted the LOVE of God towards</hi> us. And verſe 10. <hi>Herein is LOVE, not that wee LOVED God, but that hee LO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VED us.</hi> And verſe 11. <hi>Beloved, if God SO LOVED us.</hi> Rom. 5.8. <hi>But God commendeth his LOVE towards us.</hi> So alſo <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4.5. <hi>His great LOVE wherewith HE LOVED <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> and 5.2. <hi>Chriſt alſo hath LOVED us.</hi> Again, <hi>Titus</hi> 3, 4, 5. <hi>The kindneſſe and LOVE of God towards man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</hi> So alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>He LO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VED us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi> All which places, and others of the like nature, where mention is made of the love of God, we are to underſtand to be ſpoken of the <hi>everlaſting, powerfull, quickening, pardoning, ſaving LOVE</hi> of God in his Sonne: as is manifeſt to ſuch,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98399:48"/>who read with underſtanding. And, as I ſaid, I doe not know any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſpeakes of the <hi>love of God</hi> to men in ſending or giving Chriſt for them (for this the thing in hand) but wee are to underſtand it to bee ſpoken of the <hi>everlaſting ſaving love</hi> of God to them.</p>
            <p>And this leads me now to the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing conſiderable in the words, and that is, <hi>He</hi> GAVE <hi>his onely begotten Sonne. God ſo loved the world, that he</hi> GAVE <hi>his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne.</hi> Which words include in them, <hi>his ſending of him,</hi> and <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him up to death;</hi> for that which in this verſe is called <hi>giving,</hi> is in the next verſe called <hi>ſending.</hi> Now I do not read any where in Scripture, that God is ſaid to <hi>give, ſend,</hi> or <hi>deliver his Son unto death:</hi> or, that Chriſt is ſaid, ſo to <hi>give himſeif</hi> for any: but wee are to underſtand therein the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting bleſſedneſſe</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> of thoſe for whom God <hi>gave, ſent,</hi> or <hi>delivered</hi> him unto death.</p>
            <p>And this followes naturally, and ſweetly upon the former conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98399:49"/>to wit, That Gods <hi>giving, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> or <hi>delivering</hi> his Son unto death is a fruit flowing from the <hi>everlaſting, free, rich, ſaving love</hi> of God, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalvation unto all thoſe for whom God gave him.

            </p>
            <p>All theſe Scriptures teacheth us, <hi>(and I know no Scripture to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)</hi> that Gods <hi>giving, ſending,</hi> or <hi>delivering</hi> of his onely begotten Son unto death, doth include in it the <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> and <hi>ſalvation of all thoſe</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:98399:50"/>for whom God <hi>gave him, ſent him,</hi> or <hi>delivered him</hi> unto death.</p>
            <p>Now then, to returne to the place in hand; If by the <hi>love</hi> of God in this place, we are to underſtand the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, powerfull, quickning, ſaving love</hi> of God; And if Gods <hi>giving ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> or <hi>delivering</hi> his Sonne unto death, doth include in it the <hi>bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> of all thoſe for whom <hi>he gave him,</hi> or <hi>delivered him</hi> unto death; I doe then conclude, that by the <hi>World</hi> in this Scripture, we may not vnderſtand <hi>all perſons,</hi> or <hi>all men and women</hi> in the world from firſt to laſt: for then it would follow <hi>that God loved all perſons in the world with an everlaſting, powerful, quickning ſaving love in his Sonne:</hi> and <hi>that all perſons in the world ſhould certainely be ſaved and bleſſed by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>

               <note place="margin">A twofold glorious myſtery in this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And the words thus vnderſtood doe hold forth to us a twofold glorious Myſterie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> that God ſo loved that vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſiſed, forlorne, hopeleſſe former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly farre off, (as I may ſay) forgot peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the World, the nations of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Aliens, ſtrangers, Common and uncleane, (as Peter cals them,) Wilde beaſts, creeping things, fowles of the Ayre, (as the Lord expreſſeth them. Acts, 10.) that he gave his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne for them, to ſave them,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98399:51"/>to give them remiſſion of ſinnes, and everlaſting life, through believing in him.</p>
            <p>I ſay in theſe words we have held forth to us this glorious myſterie, this exceeding abounding love of God to this World, which was hidden from former ages and generations, but was made manifeſt in due time. <hi>God So loved the World, So</hi> richly, <hi>So</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abundantly, <hi>ſo</hi> as was never knowne or heard of before, that <hi>he gave his onely begotten Sonne</hi> to bring redemption and ſalvation vnto them. <hi>The Sonne of man was lifted up for all Nations of the World.</hi> The braſen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent (as all other ſhadowes of Chriſt, and ordinances of the Law) was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated unto the Iewiſh nation onely: but the Son of man was lifted up, <hi>That whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>(whoſoever belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him)</hi> doth not imply any power in loſt man to come to Chriſt, or beleeve in him: But they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to ſhew, that there was a doore of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> ſet open <hi>for all
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98399:51"/>nations,</hi> yea for this <hi>moſt hopeleſſe</hi> and <hi>moſt wretched WORLD</hi> through the death of Chriſt. And therfore the Lord Ieſus ſpeaking of his death, in Iohn 12.32. he ſaith, <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the Earth, will draw all NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS of the WORLD to beleeve in me.</hi> Here is the exceeding riches of the love of God magnified to this moſt hopeleſſe world, in the death of his Sonne, who never till now taſted the ſweetneſſe of the ſame. And thus it followes in that place of Iohn. 3.17. <hi>God ſent his Sonne into the world (that is into or upon the Earth) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the WORLD that is the nations of the world: but that the world through him might be ſaved,</hi> that is, He was not ſent to execute vengeance upon this forlorne, formerly forgotten, caſt-out, hopeleſs world: but God ſo magnified his free, rich, vnſpeakeable, unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, everlaſting love to this moſt wretched, moſt hopeleſſe <hi>world,</hi> that he gave his onely begotten Son to die <hi>for them,</hi> that they might certainely and powerfully enjoy <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> through him. This I conceive to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98399:52"/>be the true and naturall meaning of this Scripture.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome (who take hold of the word <hi>(might)</hi> in this Scripture) doe ſay, that all perſons in the world <hi>(might)</hi> be ſaved: and that all <hi>(might)</hi> be ſaved who are not ſaved: I deſire them to conſider that the word <hi>(might)</hi> in this place doth carry in it the force of an vndoubted and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute certainty, and it is as much in this place as <hi>(ſhall)</hi> be ſaved, or <hi>ſhall certainly</hi> be ſaved. J ſhall propound ſome other Scriptures (a few for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) to cleare up the truth of this to us. Gal. 1.4. <hi>He gave himſelfe for our finnes, that he (MIGHT) redeeme us from this preſent evill world,</hi> and 4.4.5. <hi>God ſent forth his Son to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons,</hi> Epheſ. 5.25.26.27. <hi>Chriſt loved the Church and gave himſelfe for it that he (MIGHT) ſanctifie it, and that he (MIGHT) preſent it to himſelfe a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church.</hi> Titus 2.14. <hi>He gave himſelfe for us that he (MIGHT) ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme us from all iniquitie.</hi> 1 Iohn. 4.9. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98399:52"/>God towards us, becauſe God ſent his onely befotten Sonne into the world that we (MIGHT) live through him.</hi> Now J deſire the underſtanding Reader to conſider whether the word <hi>(might)</hi> in theſe Scriptures doth not carry in it the force of an vndoubted certainty, and an abſolute promiſe or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: to wit, that the thing <hi>is done,</hi> or <hi>ſhall certainly, and undoubtedly</hi> be done. And ſo in this place, where he ſaith, The world through him <hi>(might)</hi> bee ſaved: the meaning is, The world through him <hi>ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>powerfully</hi> be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And this will be yet more cleare, if we conſider, what the holy Spirit meaneth, when hee ſaith, <hi>(through him.)</hi> The world <hi>(through him)</hi> might be ſaved: that is, <hi>Through his death, through his life, through the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forth of his Spirit to them,</hi> ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them to beleeve in him unto life everlaſting. And thus the world is ſaved through him.</p>
            <p>And thus I have cleared up the firſt glorious myſtery which is held forth to us in this Scripture, to wit,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98399:53"/>That God ſo loved that uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, forlorn, hopeleſſe, far-off peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Nations of the Gentiles, the world, aliens, ſtrangers, common and unclean, wilde beaſts, creeping things, fowles of the aire, (ſo called as ſtanding in oppoſition to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church) that he gave his onely begotten Sonne for them, that they might certainly beſaved throughhim.</p>
            <p>The ſecond glorious myſtery held forth in theſe words, is this, to wit,</p>
            <p>That the onely way to life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, is through <hi>beleeving</hi> in the Sonne of God. <hi>This is that rightouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is of faith,</hi> which ſtands in oppoſition to the <hi>righteouſneſſe of the Law.</hi> The righteouſneſſe which is of the Law, ſaith on this wiſe, The man which doth theſe things, ſhall live by them. But here is another, a new, a bleſſed leſſon which the Lord Ieſus teacheth <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> &amp; is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our learning, to wit, That the Son of Man is lifted up, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>beleeveth in him,</hi> ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but have everlaſting life. We are not to underſtand beleeving in this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98399:53"/>Scripture, or any other of the like nature, to be mentioned as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or worke wrought by us: but we are to underſtand it as ſtanding in oppoſition to working for life and ſalvation. The way to life is not by <hi>our workings,</hi> or <hi>our righteouſneſſe:</hi> but in <hi>receiving the righteouſneſſe of another,</hi> to wit, of the Lord Jeſus, through the faith of the operation of God. And thus we are to underſtand all theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which ſpeak of juſtification by faith. We are not juſtified and ſaved by our own working, or our own righteouſneſſe, but in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the righteouſneſſe of another, through the faith of the operation of God.</p>
            <p>And thus (through the helpe of God) I have cleared this Scripture from that corrupt ſenſe which they put upon it: and have declared the minde of God in it.</p>
            <p>And thus that fore-named Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (Ioh. 1.29) and this doe agree in one.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In the very ſame ſenſe that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous</hi> is <hi>the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our ſins,</hi> in the very ſame ſenſe, (and in no other) hee is the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world: that is, he is the propitiation for fins under one and the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration onely. Now the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit teacheth us, (and it is beſt to cleave to his teſtimony) <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>That God ſet forth Jeſus Chriſt to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.</hi> The holy Spirit here teacheth us in what ſenſe, or under what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, Jeſus Chriſt is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98399:55"/>or reconciliation for ſinnes, to wit, <hi>through faith in his blood:</hi> that is, he is the propitiation for the ſins of thoſe, and thoſe onely, who do beleeve in him, for remiſſion of ſins. And thus we are to underſtand the word <hi>(Our)</hi> in this place of <hi>John,
<note place="margin">Iohn 5.3.</note> He is the propitiation for OVR ſins:</hi> that is, for us who (through his power doe beleeve in him unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For it is well known that <hi>John</hi> writes here unto beleevers, ſuch as beleeved in Chriſt unto remiſſion of ſinnes. And in the very ſame ſenſe wee are to underſtand that in the fourth chapter of this Epiſtle, verſe 10. <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Sonne to bee the propitiation for our ſinnes:</hi> that is, ſuch or ſo great is the love of God, that he hath given us remiſſion of ſinnes, and reconciliation with himſelfe through faith in the blood of his Sonne. To the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alſo is that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son:</hi> that is, through faith in his death, as is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98399:55"/>moſt plain from the former part of the chapter. And verſe 11. <hi>We joy in God through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by whom we have now received the atonement.</hi> Wee have received the atonement: that is, we are reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God through faith in Chriſt. Now then, if the holy Spirit witnes that Jeſus Chriſt is the propitiation, or reconciliation for ſinnes, <hi>through faith in his blood,</hi> and no otherwiſe: and that he is no propitiation, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, or redemption to any, but <hi>through faith in his blood only:</hi> I then conclude, that by the whole world in this place, we can in no wiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all perſons, or every man and woman in the world.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon is taken from the conſideration of the end and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this propitiation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and that is here expreſſed to be <hi>for ſins,</hi> that is, for the remiſſion of ſins. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever have a part or intereſt in this propitiation, they have all their ſins fully and perfectly remitted to them, waſhed away in his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood. There is not one perſon
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98399:56"/>to or for whom Chriſt is a propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or reconciliation, but he hath all his ſins waſhed away in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood, and ſhall certainly be ſaved. Therefore this cannot agree to all perſons in the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſomething is to be learned from the connexion of theſe words with thoſe before-going, <hi>If any man ſin</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: And he is the propitiation for our ſinnes; and not for ours onely, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole world.</hi> Hence I conclude, that all thoſe for or to whom Jeſus Chriſt is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, he is for them an <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate alſo.</hi> And though ſome do ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate between the propitiation and advocation, ſaying, That hee is the <hi>propitiation</hi> for many, for whom hee is not an <hi>Advocate:</hi> yet certainly, theſe two are ſo inſeparably linked together, that though we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them, yet we muſt not, yea we cannot ſeparate them. There is no <hi>advocation</hi> without <hi>propitiation,</hi> ſuch a weak, empty, and beggarly benefit,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98399:56"/>as that it goeth alone without <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</hi> And ſurely thoſe who doe underſtandingly know what is the end and beneſit of this <hi>propitiation,</hi> and under what conſideration Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>propitiation for ſinnes,</hi> to wit, <hi>through faith in his blood:</hi> they will acknowledge with me, that all thoſe for or to whom Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>propitiation,</hi> he is for them an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> alſo. And how this can agree to all perſons, or to every perſon in the world, I leave to the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the underſtanding Reader.</p>
            <p>And having thus farre cleared the words from that corrupt ſenſe, it is needfull that I ſhew what is the true and naturall meaning of them.</p>
            <p>I deſire therefore it may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that this expreſſion <hi>(the whole world)</hi> is diverſly taken in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Sometimes for the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the earth, with the creatures in it. So wee are to underſtand that expreſſion of <hi>Elihu,</hi> in <hi>Iob.</hi> 34.13.</p>
            <p>Sometimes for the glory, riches, and pleaſures of this preſent world.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98399:57"/>So it is taken in <hi>Math.</hi> 16.26. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.36. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.25.</p>
            <p>Sometimes for the generality of all Nations, as ſtanding in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to a little or ſmall number amongſt them. So it is to bee taken in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9.10. and 11. verſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together. And chapt. 16.14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19. In theſe Scriptures the generality of people of all nations of the world, as wicked and ungodly, doe ſtand in oppoſition to the little or ſmall number of beleevers among them.</p>
            <p>Sometimes this expreſſion <hi>(the whole world)</hi> is taken for all nations and kindreds of people, as ſtanding in oppoſition to one nation or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of people onely. So it is taken <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.13. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8. And ſo wee are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that of <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. Goe yee into all the world, and preach the Goſpel unto every creature; that is, Goe yee amongſt all nations and kindreds,

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98399:57"/>place of <hi>Iohn,</hi> we are to underſtand all nations &amp; kindreds of the world, as ſtanding in oppoſition to one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or one part, or one nation of the world onely. This then is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>to wit, Ieſus Chriſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who is our advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is the propitiation</hi> or reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation <hi>for our ſinnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">It is well knowne that Iohn did nextly vvrite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ievvs. A tvvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the vvords.</note> who amongſt the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation doe beleeve in him unto righteouſneſſe: <hi>and not for ours onely,</hi> but alſo <hi>he is the propitiation</hi> or reconciliation for the ſinnes of thoſe who amongſt all nations of the whole world, do and ſhall hereafter beleeve in him unto righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>The words thus conſidered, doe hold forth unto us a two-fold glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous myſtery, to wit,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is no remiſſion of ſinnes, reconciliation, or redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, but onely through faith in the blood of Chriſt, which cleanſeth us from all ſinne. This is the meaning of that place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. God hath ſet forth his Son to be a propitiation through faith in his blood. And ſo it ſtands in oppoſition to the Law
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98399:58"/>of works, which ſaith on this wiſe, <hi>The man that doth theſe things, ſhall live by them.</hi> This indeed is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous myſtery, which is the ſumme of the Goſpel, Jeſus Chriſt is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation or reconciliation through faith in his blood. Neither is there any remiſſion of ſins, reconciliation, or redemption, but onely through faith in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the grace of God, by the death of Chriſt, is more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enlarged and ſtretched forth, then in former ages and generations. Untill the death of Chriſt, that which was revealed (which was in figures and ſhadowes) was limited and bounded unto the Jewiſh nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely, as it were in a corner of the world: but in theſe after ages and generations, by the death of Chriſt, it was enlarged and extended unto all nations of the world. And this is the meaning of that place in the fourth chapter of this Epiſtle, v. 14. <hi>We have ſeen and doe teſtifie that the Father ſent the Sonne, the Saviour of the world.</hi> Where it is to bee noted,

               </gap>ifeſtation of the rich love &amp; grace of God to the nations of the Gentiles in giving remiſſion of ſins &amp; ſalvation to them by Jeſus Chriſt, doth directly and properly belong to the <hi>Father's ſending of his Sonne.</hi> Wee have ſeene and doe teſtifie that the Father <hi>(ſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his Sonne)</hi> the Saviour of the world. This is indeed a glorious myſtery. And thus Jeſus Chriſt the rignteous is the propitiation, reconcihation, or redemption for the full and perfect remiſſion of the ſinnes of the whole world. And thus, the whole world without any difference, ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins and everlaſting life, through faith in the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now judge thou, underſtanding Reader, whether this that I have ſaid be not agreeable both to this Scripture in hand, and many others alſo.</p>
            <p>Another Scripture propounded by them is that in John 6.51.
<note place="margin">The 8th Scripture.</note> The words are theſe following, <hi>The bread that I will give, is my fleſh, which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98399:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>I will give for the life of the World.</hi> By <hi>World</hi> here, they underſtand, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all perſons, or every man and woman in the world.</p>
            <p>I ſhall propound one or two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from theſe words,
<note place="margin">The clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the vvords by reaſons.</note> and thoſe before-going to cleere them from that corrupt ſence which they put upon them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I deſire the Reader warily to obſerve, that whereas it is ſaid in this verſe, <hi>I will give my fleſh (for) the life of the world.</hi> It is ſaid above in the 33. verſe, <hi>The bread of God is he which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth life (VNTO) the World.</hi> So that, to be life <hi>(for)</hi> the world, it is to be life <hi>unto the world,</hi> in Chriſts meaning.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if any ſhall doubt what life is here meant, Let them know, that it is no other then <hi>everlaſting life,</hi> or <hi>life for ever;</hi> as it is expreſſed in the 47 and 51. verſes. I therefore conclude, That if Chriſt thus give himſelf to be life <hi>for</hi> the world, that is, to be everlaſting life <hi>unto</hi> the world: we cannot underſtand that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98399:59"/>by the <hi>world</hi> in this place is meant all perſons;
<note place="margin">The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them.</note> or every perſon in the world. But by <hi>world</hi> in this place, we are to underſtand (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) the Nations of the Gentiles, who are here called the <hi>world,</hi> and in other places, the <hi>Heathen,</hi> the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion,</hi> as ſtanding in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the Jewiſh Church, who alone in their times had the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many glorious priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
            <p>And thus there is a glorious my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery held forth in theſe words,
<note place="margin">A myſtery in them.</note> to wit:</p>
            <p>That <hi>Manna</hi> (as all other things alſo which were for the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhadowes &amp; figures of Chriſt) was <hi>appropriated</hi> by God unto the Jewiſh Nation only. And therefore they ſay, <hi>Our Fathers did eat Manna in the Deſert,</hi> verſe 31. And Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to it, <hi>Your Fathers did eat Manna in the Deſert,</hi> verſe 49.

               </gap> much briefly concerning that Scripture.</p>
            <p>A Ninth Scripture propounded by them is John 4.42.
<note place="margin">The ninth Scripture</note> The words are theſe following, <hi>And they ſaid unto the woman, Now we believe not becauſe of thy ſaying: for wee have heard him our ſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By world here they underſtand,
<note place="margin">The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it.</note> as before, <hi>all perſons,</hi> or every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world. I ſhall be brief in the clearing of this Scripture. It is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98399:60"/>well knowne to every underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Reader, that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> (with whom Jeſus was now dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and by whom theſe words are here uttered) were the Nations of the Gentiles, which the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> placed in <hi>Samaria</hi> when he carryed away the Iſraelites cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, 2 Kings 17.24. Theſe Nations of the Gentiles are called the <hi>world,</hi> as ſtanding in oppoſition to the Jewiſh Church, being a <hi>people farre off,</hi> as it were <hi>forgotten,</hi> and <hi>without hope</hi> untill the manifeſtation and ſuffering of Chriſt in the fleſh. With this <hi>world,</hi> as being a firſt fruits of the calling of the Gentiles, Jeſus Chriſt is now dealing, and by his power reveales himſelfe and grace in them, whereby they taſted and knew his love and grace towards them, and their redemption and ſalvation by him: for no leſſe then ſo is the meaning of the words. Mark it, In the verſe before-going it is ſaid. <hi>Many more believed becauſe of his own word;</hi> that is, His word was mighty and powerfull in them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98399:61"/>their underſtandings to know him, and perſwading their hearts to receive him or believe in him. Upon this they make this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn profeſſion of him and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in them, <hi>Now we believe</hi> (ſaid they to the woman) <hi>not becauſe of thy word: for we have heard him our ſelves</hi> (that is, we have felt the life and power of his word in our hearts) <hi>and we know</hi> (that is, we know by moſt ſweet and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table experience) <hi>that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the world.</hi> That is, We who hitherto have bin the out-caſt world, doe now know Jeſus Chriſt, and his grace and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in us, and wee are able to ſay, not upon hear-ſay, but upon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; experience from his owne teaching, that hee is thus become the Saviour of the <hi>world,</hi> and that the world now doth enjoy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Jeſus Chriſt. Here is a preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous myſtery, and here is the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous knowledge of it. This is indeed the naturall meaning of the Holy Spirit in this Scripture, which will
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98399:61"/>in no wiſe agree to their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it.</p>
            <p>Another Scripture propounded by them, is John 12.47.

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> (as that which follows naturally upon the former) it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt (CAME) to ſave the World.</hi> Now without controverſie. Whatſoever Chriſt was <hi>ſent to</hi> doe, or <hi>came</hi> into the world to doe, he did fully and perfectly perform the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98399:62"/>ſame: for as it was his <hi>delight</hi> to do ſo, Iohn 4.34. So he was enabled with <hi>power</hi> alſo to do the ſame, Eſa 63.1. Therefore he is bold to affirm even before his Father who ſent him, when he is now ready to leave the world; <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> Iohn 17.4. And therefore when we read in Scripture that the Sonne of God <hi>(came)</hi> for ſuch an end, or to doe ſuch a work, we are to underſtand, that he did <hi>verily</hi> and <hi>perfectly,</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> performe and finiſh the ſame. The Son of God did not his worke by <hi>halues:</hi> for he had both <hi>will</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to finiſh and fulfill the ſame. Now if theſe two things be well conſidered, it will be clear to the judicious Reader, that we cannot underſtand theſe words according to their ſence: for then it would follow that every perſon in the world ſhall <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>powerfully</hi> be ſaved.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98399:62"/>are oft times in Scripture call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world, as ſtanding in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Jewiſh Church, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a people (untill the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſuffering of Chriſt in the fleſh) <hi>caſt out a farr off,</hi> and as it were, <hi>forgetten.

            <p>This interpretation of this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, I ſhall confirme from two or three reaſons ſet downe by the holy Spirit in the words before go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when certaine Greeks (which were of the Gentile nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) came up to worſhip at the feaſt, and deſired to ſee Jeſus: He being made, acquainted with it, ſaid, verſe 23. <hi>The howre is come
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98399:63"/>that the Sonne of man ſhould be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted:</hi> that is, The time is now come that the Sonne of man ſhall beglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in bringing ſalvation to the Gentiles by his death. This is that <hi>much fruite</hi> of his death, which he ſpeakes of verſe 24. And hitherto alſo tends that in verſe 28. <hi>Father glorifie thy Name: then came there a voyce from heaven, I have both glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified it, and will glorifie it againe:</hi> that is, I will more abundantly, then formerly, magnifie my grace and power by thy death, which is now at hand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, (as depending upon what before goeth) The Lord Jeſus ſaith, verſe 31. <hi>Now is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this world. By judgement</hi> here, we are to underſtand <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, deliverance, or ſalvation:</hi> and by the <hi>world,</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Nations of the Gentiles:</hi> and by the word <hi>(now)</hi> in this place, we are to underſtand the time of his <hi>perſonall death,</hi> or <hi>lifting up upon the Croſſe.</hi> This then is the meaning, to wit, Now that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98399:63"/>I am ready to be offered up upon the Croſſe, Now is the <hi>judgement, righteouſneſſe, deliverance,</hi> or <hi>ſolva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this world, that is of the Gentile nations. This is a glorious myſterie, And ſo it is ſweetly and fully agreeing to what was before propheſied by Eſa. 42.1. <hi>I have put my Spirit upon him,</hi> he <hi>ſhall bring forth judgement,</hi> that is, <hi>ſalvation</hi> to the Gentiles. And ſo it is expreſſed by Chriſt himſelfe, Mat. 12.18. <hi>I will put my Spirit upon him, and he ſhall ſhew judgement to the Gentiles.</hi> And verſe 21. <hi>And in his Name ſhall the Gentiles truſt.</hi> minde it, what was before propheſied, is now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. <hi>Now is the judgement of this world; Now ſhall the Prince of this world be caſt out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly (as yet depending upon what before goeth) He ſaith in verſe 32 <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men to me. This he ſpeake ſignifying what death he ſhould dye;</hi> that is, By the power of my death upon the Croſſe, I will draw all Nations of men to me, to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98399:64"/>be ſaved through faith in me.</p>
            <p>I deſire the Reader to lay theſe things together, and then to judge whether my interpretation of the 47. verſe be not agreeable to the mind of God.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ſaid in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the verſ, <hi>if any man heare my words and believe not, I judge him not:</hi> the meaning is, I doe not <hi>now</hi> judge him, I do not <hi>now</hi> ſit upon my Tribunall to execute vengeance: that is reſerved unto another time, or day, as it is expreſlly ſaid in the next verſe, <hi>The word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day.</hi>

            <p>The firſt reaſon is taken from the conſideration of the <hi>time,</hi> of which the holy Spirit here ſpeaks, where he ſaith, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelfe.</hi> The <hi>time</hi> (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) of which the holy Spirit here ſpeaks, is the <hi>actuall</hi> or <hi>reall manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation and ſuffering of Chriſt in the fleſh;</hi> I mean, his <hi>perſonall death,</hi> or the offering up of his owne body unto death upon the tree.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98399:66"/>glorious and wonderfull power of the death of Chriſt. This very ſame thing alſo is foretold in the 42. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter oftnis Prophefie, verſe 9. to 17 the conſideration of which I leave to the underſtanding Reader. The ſame thing (I conceve) is chiefly aimed at by the holy Spirit in this Scripture we have now in hand. It is ſaid in the 17. verſe, <hi>Old things are paſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, behold all things are become new:</hi> that is, old figures and ſhadows, and ſuch like things are paſt away, and God hath now wrought new things; he hath given his own Son to die, <hi>that is new:</hi> and in the death of Chriſt, hee hath reconciled the world to himſelfe, <hi>that is new alſo,</hi> even ſuch a thing as never before was in being, untill the Son of God ſuffered in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Thus I have, with what brevity and plainneſſe I could, declared the <hi>time</hi> of which the holy Spirit here ſpeakes of, when he ſaith, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:</hi> that is, when Chriſt ſuffered in the fleſh, when he <hi>died perſonally,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:98399:67"/>Then, I ſay, <hi>Then God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelfe.</hi> Hence I conclude, that by the <hi>world</hi> in this Scripture, we can in no wiſe underſtand <hi>all perſons,</hi> or every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world from firſt to laſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon for the clearing of the words from that corrupt ſenſe, is taken from the conſideration of the <hi>Nature</hi> of this reconciliation, which is here ſpoken of. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, is no other thing then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all their ſinnes through faith in Chriſt: It is no leſſe then making them the righteouſneſſe of God by Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore when he ſaith in this place, <hi>That Cod was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelfe,</hi> hee ſaith in the very next words, <hi>not imputing their treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now according to this Scripture not to have ſin imputed, it is to be truly bleſſed. And therefore, the very ſame thing which David in the 32. Pſalme calleth, <hi>the not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of ſinne,</hi> Paul in Rom. call-leth,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98399:67"/>
               <hi>the imputing of righteouſneſſe through faith in Christ.</hi>

                  </gap>.23.</note> And ſo farr as I know, we never reade of the <hi>not imputing of ſinne,</hi> or <hi>the imputing of righteouſneſſe,</hi> but onely through faith in Chriſt. So that, when it is ſaid, <hi>God imputed not their ſins to them,</hi> we underſtand that <hi>he imputed the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to them,</hi> through faith in him: or that they were <hi>made righteous through faith in Chriſt.</hi> And ſo it agreeth with that in the 21. verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>He was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him:</hi> that is, we who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, (for he ſpeakes of himſelfe and other helievers) <hi>are made the righteouſneſſe of God in him. And thus God was in Chriſt:</hi> that is, in the death of Chriſt, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world unto himſelfe, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them:</hi> that is, giving them the remiſſion of all their ſins, and putting them into a condition of perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and true bleſſedneſſe, through faith in Chriſt. Of this
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98399:68"/>power indeede was the <hi>perſonal I death</hi> of the Son of God, thus to reconcile the world unto God: and this power of his death hath run along ever ſince in all ages, in the miniſtry of the Goſpel, untill this time, and ſo ſhall do untill this myſtery of the Goſpel be finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Now if the <hi>time</hi> and the <hi>nature</hi> of this reconciliation be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, And if we rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the holy Spirit meaneth, when he ſaith, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelfe:</hi> We can by no meanes underſtand the <hi>world</hi> in this place to ſignifie <hi>all perſons,</hi> or every perſon in the world from firſt to laſt.</p>
            <p>But by <hi>world</hi> in this place, we are to underſtand the Gentiles, who by the power of the death of Chriſt (and not untill then, except ſome firſt fruits) were reconciled to God, through faith in him. This then is the ſumme and meaning of thſe words, to wit, <hi>God was in Chriſt</hi> (that is, in the death of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98399:68"/>Chriſt) <hi>reconciling the world</hi> (that is, the Gentiles) <hi>unto himſelfe, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them,</hi> that is, giving them remiſſion of all their ſins, and putting them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a condition of perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and true bleſſedneſſe, through faith in Chriſt, wrought in them by the power of God in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſtry of reconciliation. And thus (as I conceive) this Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth moſt ſweetly with that in Rom. 11.11.12.13, 14, 15. In which place the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are called the <hi>world</hi> as ſtanding in oppoſition <hi>to Iſrael according to the fleſh;</hi> This <hi>world</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>reconciled;</hi> The <hi>time</hi> of this reconciliation is upon the ſtumbling of the Jewes at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt crucified, and the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt crucified unto the Gentiles; The nature of this reconciliation of the Gentiles is no leſſe then ſalvation through faith in Chriſt; all which the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Reader will finde out in the peruſuall of this Scripture. And thus the words of God do moſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98399:69"/>ſweetly accord with one another. Thus much for this Scripture.</p>

This indeede is a certaine truth: but that he did ſo for all perſons in the world from firſt to laſt, this Scripture doth not affirme. In the 28. verſe, it is ſaid, He was once offered to beare the ſins of many, that is perfectly and powerfully to take them away from them, in reſpect of the merit and Lording power of them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore minde it, whenſoever you reade in Scripture that Chriſt doth <hi>beare ſins, take away ſins, or put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſins.</hi> We are to underſtand no leſſe then the <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>powerfull

Theſe things being well conſidered, it will be manifeſt to the underſtanding Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it is a perverting and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Scripture, to conclude from hence, that Jeſus Chriſt died
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98399:71"/>or ſuffered for the ſins of <hi>all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> or <hi>every perſon</hi> from firſt to laſt.</p>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98399:71"/>when he ſaith in the 51. verſe <hi>That he ſhould die for that nation;</hi> he meaneth the Jewiſh nation: And when he ſaith in the following verſe, <hi>And not for that nation onely, but that he ſhould gather together in one the children of God that were ſcattered abroad:</hi> he meaneth, the outcaſt Gentiles: for ſuch a ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, diſperſed, outcaſt, hopeleſſe people were they (as I have before proved) untill they were gathered to the Lord, and into the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his body by the death of Chriſt. And if any ſhall aske, why they are here called, <hi>the children of God?</hi> I anſwer, They are ſo called in this place, (as I conceive) not according to what they were for preſent, as though they were the children of God before they were gathered unto him, by the power of the death of Chriſt: but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what they ſhould be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, as a bleſſed fruite flowing from the power of the death of Chriſt. And ſo we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand (as I conceive) thoſe words
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98399:72"/>of Chriſt in Iohn 10.15.16. and thoſe of Paul Epheſ. 5.25.</p>
            <p>The ſecond myſtery declared in theſe words is, the glorious ſaving power of the death of Chriſt; for when he ſaith in the 51. verſe, <hi>That he ſhould die for that nation:</hi> he meaneth, <hi>that he ſhould ſave them, that he ſhould bring them to God, that they periſh not.</hi> And the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing do teach ſo much: for he there ſaith, <hi>And not for that nation onely, but that he ſhould gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one the children of God that are ſcattered abroad.</hi> The force of the words lyeth in that expreſſion of <hi>gathering together:</hi> whereby we are taught, that ſuch is the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſaving power of the death of Chriſt <hi>to gather together ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and loſt, and out-caſt ones.</hi> And we are here further taught, <hi>That to die for them,</hi> and <hi>to gather them together in one,</hi> is one and the ſame thing, as is plaine by comparing the 51. and 52. verſes together. So that in the Scripture ſenſe, <hi>to die for them,</hi> it is <hi>to ſave them,</hi> it is <hi>to bring
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98399:72"/>them to God,</hi> it is <hi>to gather them from their ſcattered loſt eſtate, into an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of fellowſhip with God, and one with another in him.</hi> For it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to <hi>ſeparate</hi> betweene Chriſts dying for loſt men, and his gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of loſt men to God by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his death. This Scripture, being thus cleared, is of ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, but in no wiſe tending to juſtifie their opinion.</p>

            <p>The words in Eſaias are theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my ſalvation unto the end of the Earth.</hi> In the Acts, the words are, <hi>I have ſet thee to be a light of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that thou ſhouldeſt be for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the ends of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly open the words, and then it will appear how unfitly they urge them to juſtifie their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:98399:73"/>
            <p>
               <hi>I have ſet thee, or given thee</hi> (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king concerning Chriſt) <hi>to be a light to, or of the Gentiles;</hi> that is, Thou ſhalt be a light in them, revealing in them, and giving to them remiſſion of ſinnes, ſalvation, life everlaſting through faith in Chriſt. Thou ſhalt cauſe the light of the glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Chriſt to ſhine into their hearts. I have before proved (and ſo much is taught in the words now in hand) that untill the death of Chriſt, the Gentiles did wholly ſit in darkneſſe, being denied of God all thoſe Lawes, Ordinances, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Priviledges, Miracles, which the Jewes enjoyed, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, as ſo many meanes whereby Chriſt did gloriouſly, for the time preſent, ſhine forth among them.</p>

            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:98399:73"/>
            <p>And whereas, it is ſaid in the next words, That thou ſhouldeſt be <hi>(for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alvation)</hi> unto the ends of the earth. Theſe words doe juſtifie the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the former; for ſuch a light is Chriſt, <hi>giving ſalvation, or bringing ſalvation</hi> unto all thoſe to whom he is a light; that is, Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth himſelfe in them, drawing their hearts to believe in him unto life everlaſting. And therefore, it is ſaid in the next words. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternall life, believed.</hi> For indeed, thus Chriſt is light and ſalvation to us, as he reveales him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in us, drawing us thereby to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in himſelf unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhall object, that it is here ſaid, He <hi>(ſhould)</hi> be for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I anſwer, The word <hi>ſhould,</hi> or <hi>might,</hi> in this Scripture as in others of the like nature) doth ſignifie no leſſe then <hi>ſhall,</hi> He <hi>ſhall</hi> be my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the ends of the earth. And therefore Eſaias ſaith in Chap. 52.10. <hi>The Lord hath made bare his holy arme in the eyes of all the Nations: and all the ends of the earth SHALL ſee
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98399:74"/>the ſalvation of God.</hi> They <hi>ſhall</hi> ſee it, that is, they <hi>ſhall</hi> look upon Jeſus Chriſt, and believe in him, and bee ſaved by him. As it is written, <hi>Looke unto me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas it is here ſaid, Hee ſhall be for ſalvation unto the <hi>(ends of the earth.)</hi> the meaning is, unto all Nations, or Kindreds of the earth. And Eſaias, in the forenamed place, doth make it plain, The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of <hi>all the nations,</hi> and <hi>all the ends of the earth</hi> ſhall ſee the ſalvation of our God.

               </gap> not unwarrantably urged by them to maintain their opinion of Chriſts dying for all perſons, or every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world from firſt to laſt.</p>
            <p>And thus (as the Lord hath help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me) I have examined the ſever all Scriptures propounded by them, and declared the minde of God in them.
<note place="margin">The reaſons vvhich ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to juſtifie this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I now proceed to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome reaſons propounded by them, to prove (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) that Chriſt died for the ſins of all perſons.</p>
            <p>And they are theſe following:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe (ſay they) Chriſt and the Prophets, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and Apoſtles did ſoteach, Eſa 53.6. Iohn 1.29. and 3 16, 17. and 6.51. and 12.47, 48. 1 Cor. 15.3.2 Cor. 5.14, 15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe (ſay they) Chriſt required them ſo to preach, Mat. 28.18, 19. Mark 16.15. Luke 10.5. and 24.47. Rom. 16.26.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> becauſe (ſay they) the Saints are commended for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98399:75"/>ſo, Iohn 4.42. 1 Iohn 4.14.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> becauſe (ſay they) it is a condemning ſinne in any, hearing the Goſpell, not to believe ſo, to wit, that Chriſt died for their ſins, Iohn 3.18 19. and 12.47, 48. and 16 9. 1 Iohn 5.10.</p>
            <p>Theſe four reaſons I find expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Mr. <hi>Lambe</hi> in a little boek.</p>
            <p>To their firſt reaſon,
<note place="margin">The tryall of them.</note> I anſwer, That neither Chriſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> nor the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, nor the Apoſtles did ſo teach. And as for the Scriptures they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (to prove as they conceive, their opinion) to wit, Eſa 53.6. Ioh. 1.29. and 3.16, 17. and 6.51. and 12.47, 48. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. I have before proved, that they held forth no ſuch thing: And I have at large declared the naturall meaning of each of them; And therefore I ſhall ſay no more in this place concerning them: but referre the Reader to the conſideration of what I have at large above ſaid. And as for the Scripture 1 Cor. 15.3. (of which I have formerly ſaid nothing) where it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt died for our ſinnes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98399:76"/>to the Scriptures:</hi> I anſwer doth he there ſay that Chriſt died for the ſins of <hi>all perſons,</hi> or <hi>every perſon?</hi> Doth he not ſay, Chriſt died for <hi>(our)</hi> ſins? that is, for us who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, and believe in him, and ſtand faſt in his grace and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; He died for <hi>Our</hi> ſins, and we ſhall be ſaved by him, as he plainly ſpeakes in the firſt and ſecond verſes. This is that Goſpel which he here ſpeakes of, and remindes the Brethren of, to wit, That the alone way whereby to attaine unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, remiſſion of ſins, and ſalvation, is onely through faith in the death of Chriſt, and ſtanding faſt in the grace and righteouſneſſe of the Lord Jeſus. So much in anſwer to the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> (ſay they) Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his Apoſtles and Diſciples ſo to preach. And for this purpoſe, they alledge Mat. 28.18.19. Mark. 16.15. Luke 10.5. and 24.47. Rom. 16.26.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Chriſt indeede com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Diſciples to go forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98399:76"/>all nations, and ſo make Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: as is expreſſed by Matthew. And it is true alſo, that when he ſent them forth, he commanded them, <hi>Into whatſoever houſe ye enter, firſt ſay, Peace be to this houſe:</hi> as it is expreſſed by Luke. And it is written alſo by the ſame Luke, <hi>That repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in the Name of Chriſt among all nations, beginning at Jeruſalem.</hi> And it is true alſo, as Paul expreſſeth it, <hi>That the Goſpel and the preaching of Jeſus Chriſt, is now, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the everlaſting God, made knowne to all nations for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of faith.</hi> But doth any of theſe Scriptures, or any other ſay that Chriſt required them to preach that he died for the ſins of <hi>all perſons,</hi> or <hi>of every perſon?</hi> Or can it be proved that this opinion of theirs is the Goſpel of Chriſt? And as for that of Luke 10.5. (which may ſeeme moſt difficult) where it is ſaid, <hi>Into whatſoever houſe ye enter, firſt ſay, Peace be to this houſe:</hi> We muſt underſtand, that their declaration of

            <p>Thirdly, (ſay they) The Saints are commended for believing ſo. For this purpoſe they alledge, Iohn 4.42. 1 Iohn 4.14.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, The Saints in Scripture did not believe ſo, to wit, that Chriſt died for the ſins of all perſons, or of every perſon from firſt to laſt. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it any commendation, before
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98399:77"/>God, unto any of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> who do now believe ſo: ſeeing the Scriptures rightly underſtood, holdeth forth no ſuch thing to us. And as for thoſe places of Iohn 4.42. and 1 Iohn 4.14. they admit not of ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as they put upon them, but teach another Doctrine, which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, precious and glorious: Both which things I have largely declared above, in the opening of thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe (ſay they) It is a condemning ſin, to any, hearing the Goſpel, not to believe ſo, to wit, That Chriſt died for their ſin. For this purpoſe they alledge, Iohn 3.18.19. and 12.47.48. and 16.9. 1 Iohn 5.10.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, It is moſt true, that whoſoever (though formerly never ſo ſinfull) heareth the word of Chriſt and believeth in him, that is, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> our Saviour ſubmitteth to his righteouſneſſe, truſteth in his grace, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death to life. And it is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98399:78"/>alſo moſt certaine, that whoſoever doth not believe in Jeſus Chriſt, nor ſubmit to his righteouſneſſe, nor truſt in his grace, nor kiſſe his Septer, but truſteth in his own righteouſneſſe; or loveth to continue in wayes of darkneſſe, diſobedience and rebellion againſt Chriſt: every ſuch one is in the eſtate of condemnation, none of his ſins are forgiven, but they are all and every one of them charged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and he, with all his ſins upon him, lyeth naked under the bitterneſſe and terrour of the juſt wrath of Almighty God. For indeed, there is no other way whereby we can eſcape the wrath of God, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine remiſſion of ſins and everlaſting life, but onely through believing in the righteouſneſſe of another, to wit, the Lord Jeſus: And whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is drawne, by the power of the Father to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, he is righteous even as Chriſt is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he hath all his ſins covered with the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt. But whoſoever doth not believe in him, all his ſins are uncovered, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98399:78"/>he, like a miſerable, naked, ſinfull guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, curſed wretch, lieth with all his ſinnes charged upon him, under the wrath of God. This that I have ſaid, is the very minde of GOD thoſe Scriptures above mentioned: none of which righly underſtood, doth in any meaſure ſerve to juſtifie their opinion, of Chriſts dying for the ſins of all perſons. And whereas they ſay, That there is no other means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an unbeleever ſhould become a beleever, then the hearing of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>That Chriſt died for the ſinnes of all,</hi> alledging for this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard?</hi> I anſwer, It is moſt true what the Scripture ſaith, <hi>How ſhal they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard?</hi> But that ſuch a report as they ſpeak of, is the Goſpel of Chriſt, and that which ſhould bee preached as a truth of God, cannot bee proved from the teſtimony of God, in this, or other Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Thus much in anſwer to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and reaſons propounded by them to maintain this opinion. In
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98399:79"/>which anſweres it appeares, how greatly they are miſtaken, and how much they erre in this matter from the right underſtanding of the Word of truth.</p>
            <p>And before I leave this point,
<note place="margin">Divers errors at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</note> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it not unneceſſary, to ſhew ſome other miſtakes and errors, held forth by them, moſt of which doe attend upon this opinion, of Chriſts dying for the ſins of all perſons.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble my ſelf nor the Reader with all the unſound paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of their ſeverall books: but point at thoſe which are moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>

               </gap>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:98399:79"/>contained in the 13, 14, 15. lines of page 4. and in the 19, 20, 21, 22. lines of page 5.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which, firſt, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwe </seg>
               </label> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, according to the Scripture, <hi>That all the Prophets give witneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus Chriſt, that through faith in his Name, whoſoveer beleeveth in him, ſhal receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, their concluſion is not agreeable either to the ſcope or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Scriptures they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, doe no wayes ſeem to juſtifie their concluſion: but are all of them ſpoken to, and of ſuch as actually, through the power of Chriſt, beleeve in him unto remiſſion of ſins, as the underſtanding Reader will eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this concluſion of theirs contradicts another concluſion of their own, in the 19, 20, 21, 22 lines of page 4. Where it is reſolved, by them, upon the queſtion, That all mens ſins are not pardoned in Chriſt, as a truth to be preached to, and to be beleeved by all. Now if it bee not a truth to bee
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98399:80"/>preached to all, that their ſinnes are pardoned in Chriſt, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſſe) How then can that concluſion ſtand firm, That all men ought to beleeve, that all their ſinnes are pardoned? Shall they beleeve a thing which is not a truth? And thus themſelves do contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvesr</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is affirmed by them, That nothing is required of any to make them partakers of remiſſion of ſinnes, but onely faith to beleeve the report of the Goſpel. This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtance of the 17. and 18. lines of pag 4. and 26. and 27. lines of the ſame page.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">nſw. </seg>
               </label> I deſire thee Reader to take notice eſpecially of one thing, to wit, That they make faith to conſiſt in a <hi>bare aſſent</hi> to the truth of the Goſpel. And, ſay they, nothing is required of any to make them partakers of remiſſion of ſins, but only faith to beleeve, or to aſſent unto the truth of the Goſpel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
            <p>Surely the pretious faith of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:98399:80"/>elect is of more glorious, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent nature, And though an aſſent unto the truth of the Goſpel, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in all lively, or living faith, yet ſomething elſe is required and found alſo in ſuch afaith as embraceth and receiveth Jeſus, Chriſt unto remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is reſolved, by them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the queſtion, That there are ſome evils which doe attend the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of Gods own people: For, ſay they, God doth rebuke, chaſtiſe, and judge them with temporall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, helping them thereby, as his children, to mortifie the ſinne which remaineth in them. This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the firſt queſtion and anſwer in page 6.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> That unbeleefe which remaineth in Gods owne people, is indeed an evill, as all ſin is: but that thoſe rebukes, chaſtiſements, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or corrections, which God in Judgement, that is, in meaſure, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and mercy inflicteth upon his own children, are properly evils to them, or are inflicted upon them
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98399:81"/>in the nature of evils, is not cleare to me from the teſtimony of Scripture. And they themſelves confeſſe (as is is moſt true) in the laſt queſtion and anſwer of the ſame page, That all the ſinnes of all beleevers, are ſo waſhed away in the blood of Chriſt, that the guilt of them doth not all remain againſt them. And ſurely if there bee no guilt, there is no curſe, no ſting, no evill in thoſe chaſtiſements, which God as a Father, in love, in meaſure, and for their profit, doth inflict upon them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it is reſolved by them upon the queſtion, That the ſins of all unbeleevers are waſhed away in the blood of Chriſt, as a truth to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all. To prove which (as they conceive) they alledge <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22.23, 24, 25. <hi>John</hi> 1.29. and 12.47. Chap. 3.16, 17. This is the ſubſtance of the 11, 12, 13, 14. and 15. lines of the ſixth page.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer </seg>
               </label> Firſt, the Scriptures they alledge, ſpeak no ſuch language, but the contrary, as will be evident to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very underſtanding Reader. And for

            <p>Secondly, it is moſt certain, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And I am ſure alſo, that ſuch who have their ſinnes remitted, or waſhed away in the blood of Chriſt (being juſtified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) ſhall certainly be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is reſolved, by them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the queſtion, that the ſinnes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are waſhed away otherwiſe

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98399:83"/>thus indeed there is an unſpeakle dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the condition of a beleever in the ſtate of mortality, and when mortality ſhall bee ſwallowed up of life. And this is that which thoſe fore-mentioned Scriptures, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by them, teacheth us. But what is this to prove, that the ſinnes of a beleever glorified, are otherwiſe waſhed away, then the ſinnes of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever in the eſtate of grace, not glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? This is to make remiſſion of ſins, or juſtification to bee imperfect to a beleever in this preſent life.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> they ſay; That all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doe enjoy an outward and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall benefit by Chriſt, though it be neither preached nor beleeved. This is expreſſed, by them, in the 17 and 18 lines of page 7.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer </seg>
               </label> It is not clear to me, that unbeleevers abiding in the eſtate of unbeliefe (mind that) doe enjoy any outward and temporall things as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to them. It is true indeed, they enjoy many outward things, <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good and pretious:</hi> but that they are in the nature of benefits, or
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98399:83"/>good things <hi>to them,</hi> or that Chriſt died to procure outward and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall benefits for them, as benefits <hi>to them,</hi> it is not cleare to me. But if I miſtake in this, or any other thing, I am willing to be informed.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> their interpretation of ſome paſſages of Chriſts Prayer, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. is very unagreeable to the mind of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Chriſts Prayer (ſay they) is to bee diſtinguiſhed in reſpect of the things prayed for. Some things (ſay they) were <hi>ſpeciall, onely belonging to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> verſe 9. compared with verſes 11.15. and 17. And ſome things, (ſay they) <hi>are common to all,</hi> and for ſuch things, Chriſt did pray for the <hi>world,</hi> as verſes 21, 23. though not in reſpect of the things in ſpeciall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing onely in peculiar to the <hi>Saints.</hi> And (ſay they) he onely pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the unity of the faithfull, as a means tending to cauſe the world to beleeve that his ſufferings for all is of the ſame nature, whether men beleeve it or not. This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what they ſay in the laſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98399:84"/>anſwer page 7. and the firſt anſwer page 8.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which I ſhall briefly declare, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> what I conceive, is the minde of Chriſt in theſe paſſages of his prayer, and therein I ſhall diſcover the unſoundneſſe of their interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>
            <p>Firſt, thoſe for whom he prayeth, verſes 6.11.15.17. <hi>are actuall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> ſuch as were for the <hi>preſent</hi> called of God out of the world, and given to Jeſus Chriſt, thus much he often times expreſſeth in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>Secondly, thoſe for whom he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, verſes 20.21, 22, 23. are ſuch as ſhould <hi>afterwards</hi> (that is, from that time to the end of the world) through the power of Chriſt, in the miniſtry of the Goſpel, believe in him.</p>
            <p>And whereas, he ſaith, in theſe verſes, That the <hi>(world)</hi> may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: He herein aimeth chiefly at the converſion of the Gentiles, which he here calleth the <hi>world,</hi> as they are elſe-where called in other
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98399:84"/>Scriptures, as ſtanding in oppoſition to the Jewiſh Church.</p>
            <p>And whereas, he ſaith, <hi>That the (WORLD) may believe:</hi> He doth not leave the matter as uncertaine: Neither doth this word <hi>(may)</hi> in this place ſignifie any ſuch thing, as that they may believe, or they may not: But the words do carry an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted certainty in them, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie as much, as that the <hi>world ſhall believe.</hi> And ſo much he faith in the 20. verſe, <hi>I pray for them which ſhall believe in me, through the word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith, <hi>That the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me:</hi> we are to underſtand, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture, <hi>To believe that the Father hath ſent Chriſt,</hi> is really and truly to believe in Chriſt. Thus much Chriſt teacheth us in Iohn 16.27. Where he thus wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth of his Diſciples, <hi>Ye have lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and have believed that I came out from God.</hi> And againe in this 7. chapter verſe 8. <hi>They have knowne ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have belived that thou didſt ſend
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98399:85"/>me:</hi> he meaneth, That the world may believe in him unto life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. And therefore he enlargeth himſelfe in verſe 23. where he ſaith. <hi>That the world may know that tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thou haſt loved me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, take notice, that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Chriſt, that the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me <hi>is an entire petition in it ſelfe:</hi> and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus, <hi>Father, I pray that the world may believe that thou haſt ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Laſtly, take notice, that wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> are to underſtand the world in theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> two places in a different ſenſe. By the <hi>world</hi> in verſes 9. We are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſuch as live and walke and continue to live in ignorance, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and hatred againſt Chriſt Theſe are called the <hi>world,</hi> as ſtanding
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98399:85"/>in oppoſition to whom the Father calleth, or draweth unto Jeſus Chriſt; agreeable to that in Iohn 15.18.19. And thus, he prayeth not for the world, but for thoſe whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth him out of the world verſes 6.9.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>world</hi> in verſes 21.23. we are to underſtand (as I ſaid before) the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which had not yet the Goſpel of Chriſt preached amongſt them, except ſome firſt fruits of them. Theſe are called the <hi>world,</hi> in oppoſition to the Jewiſh Church, as being an out-caſt people hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto. And for the <hi>world</hi> hee here prayeth, that they through the power of God, in the preaching of the Goſpel, may be drawne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and <hi>enjoy</hi> the love of the Father in him.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid, concerning theſe paſſages of Chriſts prayer, doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover their interpretation of the ſame to be unagreeable to the minde of Chriſt, both darkening the matter, and croſſing the very end and power of Chriſts prayer. For is there any
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98399:86"/>ſuch thing pointed at in Chriſts pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (verſes 21.23.) as that he onely prayeth (as they ſay) for the unity of the faithfull, as meanes tending to cauſe the world to believe that his ſufferings for all is of the ſame nature, whether men believe it or not? I will onely ſay thus much, that there is not onely much darkneſſe in their own words, but that they tend alſo to darken the words of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> they ſay that the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt and his prayer for all is of equall extention, as a meanes ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to cauſe them to believe; and if they do not, they are left without excuſe. This is the ſubſtance of the latter part of the firſt Anſw. page. 8.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer </seg>
               </label> firſt it is moſt true that whoſoever heareth the Goſpel of Chriſt and believeth not in him, they have no cloake nor excuſe for their ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a groſſe miſtake, and contrary to the truth of Scripture to ſay, that Chriſts ſufferings and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98399:86"/>prayer are of equall extention for all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas they ſay, that the ſufferings and prayer of Chriſt for all, are of equall extention, <hi>as a meanes tending to canſe them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and if they do not, they are left without excuſe:</hi> This is to make the ſufferings and prayer of Chriſt to be a weake meanes, without power: whereas they are mighty and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for, and unto all thoſe who are concerned in them, and not one ſhall faile to enjoy the uttermoſt benefit of them (who according to the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grace of God) are concerned therein.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, they ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh redemption, in reſpect of price, and in reſpect of the end and application. Now the price (ſay they) is payd for all. This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the 26.27.28. lines of page 9.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, I would know what difference they make betweene the payment of the price, and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it. If a ranſome be payd,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98399:87"/>is it not then applied? What is pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but application? So that in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the price is paid for all, they affirm that it is applied for the benefit of all. But if they ſay, <hi>It is paid to the Father for all, though all have not the benefit of it,</hi> I anſwer, It is a carnall and unrighteous diſtinction to ſay, that the Father hath received the full payment of the price for thoſe to whom he doth not powerfully apply the ſaving benefit of the ſame. And what is this but to charge either <hi>weakneſſe</hi> or <hi>unrighteouſneſſe</hi> upon the moſt righteous and mighty God? as though he ſhould receive the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the price, or ranſome, at the hands of Chriſt for thoſe, to whom he will not, or cannot powerfully apply the ſaving benefit of the ſame?</p>
            <p>And as for the Scriptures they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. I have above in their proper places ſhewed the meaning of them.</p>
            <p>And whereas they make ſuch a difference between the giving of the price for men, and to men: I have already declared, that the giving of the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98399:87"/>price for men and to men, according to the Scripture, ſignifieth the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, they ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> although Faith and Chriſt bee not given to all, yet this hinders not but that he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for all: and this appeares (ſay they) in that ſome for whom hee is given, doe deny him. To confirm this, they alledge, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.42. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.11. Theſe things are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by them in the 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. lines of page 12.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> firſt let the Reader take notice how they miſtake in putting faith before Chriſt. There are their own words: <hi>To whomſoever God giveth faith, and ſo Chriſt.</hi> And again, <hi>To them he gives with that faith and that Chriſt.</hi> And again, <hi>Although Faith and Chriſt be not given to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now certainly, here is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in putting Faith before Chriſt. But concerning this, I will onely ſay thus much, That God in giving Chriſt into the heart of any man, gives him faith to receive him, or beleeve in him.</p>
            <pb n="158" facs="tcp:98399:88"/>
            <p>Secondly, whereas they ſay, It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares hee ſuffered for all, becauſe ſome for whom he is given, doe deny him: I will prove their Argument it ſelfe (according to their ſenſe) to be unſound, and then their concluſion from it, will further appeare to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound alſo. Their Argument is this, <hi>That ſome for whom Chriſt is given, do deny him.</hi> This they would prove from 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Math.</hi> 21.42. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.11. that of <hi>Pet.</hi> ſeems the moſt ſtrong for them, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There were falſe Prophets alſo among the people, even as there ſhall bee falſe teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them.</hi> They take much hold of theſe words of <hi>Peter, They deny the Lord that bought them.</hi> Concerning which Scripture in way of anſwer and reſolution,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay, that this Scripture in it ſelfe, and being rightly underſtood, is moſt holy, ſpirituall, and pretious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſay, that all thoſe, whom Chriſt the Lord <hi>buyeth,</hi> or <hi>redeemeth,</hi> he redeemeth them <hi>perfectly</hi> and <hi>for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98399:88"/>ever:</hi> and not one of his redeemed ones ſhall <hi>thus deny him,</hi> or <hi>be denied by him,</hi> but ſhall be enabled to owne him, and ſhall be owned by him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.2. and 111.9. and 130.7.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38, 39. And therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> here ſaith, <hi>They deny the Lord that bought them,</hi> hee doth not mean that ſuch perſons are <hi>really</hi> and <hi>in truth</hi> the redeemed, or bought ones of the Lord Chriſt: for that were to croſſe the truth of the Scriptures, and the nature, power, and end of the redemption of the Lord Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, he meaneth that theſe perſons here ſpoken of, are bought or redeemed <hi>in point of profeſſion,</hi> not in truth and reallity: that is, they do for a time, and it may be for a long time, <hi>profeſſe themſelves</hi> to be the bought or redeemed ones of the Lord Chriſt: they are ſuch as are much enlightned, and know much concerning the way of righteouſneſſe, concerning the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his death and ſhedding of his pretious blood: they doe for a time
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98399:89"/>
               <hi>make ſhew</hi> to be waſhed and cleanſed from the ſinnes and pollutions of the world, and to caſt up all ſuch unclean wayes like a filthy vomit: and they make <hi>large profeſſion</hi> of receiving the Commandements of God, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wayes of righteouſneſſe: and in <hi>reſpect of profeſſion,</hi> they ſeeme to be living trees, and ſuch as bring forth much fruit of knowledge, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and righteouſneſſe: and upon a <hi>profeſſion</hi> of knowledge and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they deſire to joyn themſelves with the Saints, and are received by them into the fellowſhip of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, walking with them in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and worſhip of the Houſe of God. In a word, they are very Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in profeſſion, making a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, profeſſing themſelves to bee the bought or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones of the Lord Chriſt. But after ſome time (having not the faith nor love of Chriſt within them, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no root in themſelves,</hi> or <hi>having not the root of the matter in them</hi>) in time of triall, and through covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for the love of gain, or of the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98399:89"/>wages of unrighteouſneſſe, they turne from the holy commandement, they forſake the wayes of truth and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, all their former fruit of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, love and obedience, now wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth, and they now appeare to be indeed rotten and dead trees, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever profeſſion of life, and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they formerly made; they now turn again, like the Dog to their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:98399:90"/>with underſtanding, will eaſily underſtand in the peruſall of this whole ſecond chapter, that which I have ſaid herein is the very minde of God. Hitherto alſo is agreeable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Scriptures, 2 Pet. 1.9. 1 Tim. 4.1.2. and 3.4.5. Heb. 10.25, 26, 27, 28.38.39. Acts 20.30. Jude 4. to the 20. And amongſt the reſt, conſider wearily that in Acts 20.30. Where Paul ſpeaking to the Church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, he ſaith, <hi>Of your own ſelves</hi> (marke that expreſſion, <hi>Of your own ſelves, Or from amongſt your own company) ſhall men ariſe ſpeaking perverſe, things to draw away diſciples after them.</hi> And conſider alſo that of Jude, in verſe 12. (where he ſpeaking of the ſame men of whom Peter ſpeakes, who deny the Lord Jeſus, as is manifeſt verſe 4.) he ſaith in the latter end of that verſe, <hi>They are trees whoſe fruit withereth, without fruite, twice dead, plucked up by the roots:</hi> that is, In reſpect of their naturall eſtate, as fallen in Adam, they were dead; as indeed, all his poſterity, ſo conſidered, are. This
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98399:91"/>is the firſt death of theſe trees which Jude ſpeakes of. But theſe men being planted where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is preached, profeſſed, and held forth in power and ſimplicity, (by thoſe who are the called of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt) they take upon them the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and for a time make a flouriſhing confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, living Saint-like, appearing as though they were living trees, bringing forth much outward fruit of knowledge and righteouſneſſe, forſaking many ſins, and doing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in themſelves holy, good and righteous: and thus they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare like living, fruit-bearing trees: but after a while, (not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving life and root within) in time of tryall, and for covetous ends, they fall away from that profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wither away by degrees in that love, knowledge and righteouſneſſe which they once made profeſſion of, untill (after a while) they be <hi>without fruit,</hi> bringing forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bitter, unrighteous and deadly fruits. And this is the other,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98399:91"/>and ſo a double death, which Jude here ſpeakes of, which theſe trees are under the power of. And thus <hi>they are trees whoſe fruits withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus theſe Scriptures (with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the like nature) do teach us that many who have made a large and flouriſhing profeſſion of Chriſt to be their Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and themſelves to be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and redeemed ones, have fal'n from that profeſſion of Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him and walked altogether contrary to him: But none of theſe Scriptures, nor any other, do teach that any who are Chriſts, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones, receiving him, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him, ſhall at any time (no not one of them) thus deny him or be denyed by him. I have been the longer upon this place of Peter, comparing it with other Scriptures, eſpecially that of Jude (which is the very ſame with it) both that I might declare what is the minde of God in them, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98399:92"/>might alſo cleare them from thoſe falſe interpretations, which ſome, who pervert the Scriptures, would put upon them.</p>
            <p>Thus having cleared this place of Peter, I ſhall now proceed to the other two Scriptures, to wit, Mat. 21.42. Iohn 1.11. which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to prove, that ſome for whom Chriſt is given do deny him.</p>
            <p>As for that place of Mat. 21.42. where it is ſaid, <hi>The ſtone which the builders rejected,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What ſerves this place unto, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer </seg>
               </label> but to prove that ſome who profeſſe themſelves as though they were the onely builders of the Church, pull it downe. Some who in word and profeſſion are much for God, and Chriſt, and his worſhip, do in the account of God, and accordingly to the judnement of the Scripture, no leſſe then reject, or oppoſe the Lord Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And as for that place of Iohn 1.11. where it is ſaid, <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not,</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:98399:92"/>we are to underſtand, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer </seg>
               </label> that thoſe who are here called Chriſts own, are the nation of the Jewes, who are called his own as concerning the <hi>fleſh, becauſe he was made of them, or came from them:</hi> according to that, Rom. 1.3. and 9.5. Theſe indeed Chriſt came and ſent unto, and they, in reſpect of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of them, received him not. But thoſe who are Chriſts own in a ſpirituall ſenſe, that is, thoſe who are redeemed through him, drawn by him, and loved of him, they do receive him, believe in him, love him, and perſevere in this faith and love, through his power, unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation Iohn 13.1. And thus in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening theſe Scriptures, I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the unſoundneſſe of their argument, their miſunderſtanding of the Scriptures, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the corruptnes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which they draw from thence.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, It is reſolved, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> by them, upon the queſtion, that no man by nature, can know, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98399:93"/>this Doctrine, (to wit, of Chriſts redeeming all perſons, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all perſons) for (ſay they) it is a fooliſh Doctrine, and enmity to the wiſedom of every naturall man, 1 Cor. 1.23. and 2.13. and 2.14. Rom. 8.7.8. And the light and underſtanding thereof (ſay they) is onely had by the power of the Spirit of God, 1 Iohn 4.13.14. And all men naturally (ſay they) are more averſe to this then any other thing, Iohn 5.44. Mat. 23.37. This is expreſſed, by them in the 12.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 lines of page 13.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> It is moſt true that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt is holy, heavenly, ſpirituall, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry naturall man is oppoſite and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to it, neither can any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, except he be taught by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:98399:93"/>Chriſts redemption of all perſons, is in it ſelfe an unſound Doctrine, a Doctrine of men, and not of Chriſt, and it is very pleaſing to corrupt nature, neither did I ever ſee or finde Satan, or the world, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature oppoſing this Doctrine, ſimply as it is a doctrine: but I have ſeene by experience that it is a very eaſie thing to entertaine and peremptorily to hold faſt this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: yea, it is more eaſie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to corrupt nature, then ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupt opinions are: yea, ſome that are godly are too eaſily beguiled with it. Therefore their affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is unwarrantable, and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures they alledge are unrightly urged by them to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, they ſay, that the matter of free conveyance of power is offered in the covenant of grace, which would be covney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, were it not oppoſed, deſpiſed, or neglected. This is the ſubſtance of what is expreſſed, by them, in the 17.18, 19, 20, 21, 22. lines of page 14.</p>
            <pb n="170" facs="tcp:98399:94"/>
            <p>In anſwer to which concerning the ſtrangeneſſe, unſpirituallneſſe, and cloudineſſe of theſe their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, I will ſay nothing. But whereas they ſay, the matter of free conveyance of power is <hi>offered</hi> in the covenant of grace: I ſay, that the power, grace, or mercy which is held forth in this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>is abſolutely, freely, and richly promiſed.</hi> And who knoweth not but there is a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an <hi>offer,</hi> and an <hi>abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe?</hi> And I am ſure that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are truly acquainted with this covenant, they will readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that ſuch is the nature thereof, that whatſoever power, grace, or mercy is contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it is held forth by way of <hi>free</hi> and <hi>abſolute promiſe,</hi> and not of <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> onely.</p>
            <p>And whereas they ſay, The power which is offered in the covenant, would be <hi>conveyed to them,</hi> were it not oppoſed or neglected.</p>
            <p>I anſwere, That there are none who have any part or ſhare in this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98399:94"/>but thoſe with whom the Lord doth freely make it. And as for all thoſe with whom hee makes the covenant, <hi>hee doth powerfully ſubdue their ignorance, pride, and rebellion, and gives them power to receive, and embrace, and hold faſt the grace and mercy</hi> (which according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the covenant) <hi>is therein promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Therfore they are much miſtaken in the nature of the covenant of grace: for I doe not find <hi>offers</hi> only, but <hi>free</hi> &amp; <hi>abſolute promiſes</hi> in that Covenant.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, they ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth beleeve that Chriſt hath ſuffered for the ſinnes of all perſons, they doe necſſarily beleeve that there is the matter of eternall death in all, and do neceſſarily beleeve an infinite love extended to all. This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what is expreſſed by them, in the three firſt lines of page 16.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, it is moſt certain, that all perſons, by nature, are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, or of eternall death; and whoſoever beleeves this, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve a truth.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, to beleeve that there
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98399:95"/>is <hi>an infinite love extended to all,</hi> is to beleeve that which the word of truth doth no where teach. That love which is <hi>infinite,</hi> is a love <hi>without bound or limit, both in reſpect of the meaſure and time of it. That which is infinite, is without end.</hi> Therefore whatſoever their opinion, of Chriſts dying for all perſons, doth neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tie them to beleve, I am ſure the Scripture doth not teach us to beleeve ſo. And beſides, great abſurdities and untruths doth neceſſarily follow upon ſuch beliefe: for then it will certainly follow, that all perſons ſhall enjoy the unſpeakable love of God unto eternity. And whereas they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>John</hi> 3.16. It is moſt certaine, that this Scripture doth not teach us that there is an infinite love extended to all perſons from firſt to laſt. But becauſe I have already opened the meaning of this Scripture, I ſhall ſay no more of it in this place, but refer the Reader to what I have aboveſaid thereof in its proper place.</p>
            <p>Fifteenhly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> they ſay, If Chriſt hath not ſuffered for all perſons, then the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98399:95"/>Queſtion is, How ſhall I finde that hee hath ſuffered for me? But if I beleeve he hath ſuffered for all, then I doe neceſſarily beleeve that hee hath ſuffered for me. And again (ſay they) not to beleeve this, it takes away the certainty of faith from any man in reſpect of Chriſt: for if any man be excluded from the benefit of his death, I may be the perſon as ſoon as any other, and I have no ground to beleeve the contrary. And again (ſay they) No perſons have any true ground to beleeve that Chriſt hath ſuffered for them, otherwiſe then he is declared in Scripture to have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for all. And no ſaving faith (ſay they) ſtands in oppoſition to this Doctrine of Chriſts ſuffering for the ſins of all. Theſe things are expreſſed by them in the 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 lines of p. 15. And in the 19, 20, 21, 22. lines of p. 16. And in the 17.18, 19, 20, 21. 22, 23 lines of page 21.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> I have abundantly proved, and ſhall further prove, that this opinion, or doctrine of Chriſts dying for all perſons, is not a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98399:96"/>of Jeſus Chriſt, nor agreeable to the Scriptures rightly underſtood. Therefore to make this the ground, or foundation of faith (as they doe) is to build upon a ſandy foundation; And if the foundation be ſandy, I am ſure the building cannot be ſtrong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſuch a perſon is much to bee queſtioned for the truth of his faith (I ſay not for the ſtrength of his faith but for the truth of it) who hath no other, or better ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that Chriſt hath ſuffered for him, then this, that hee hath ſuffered for all perſons. And it is much to bee feared, that ſuch a one who thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and perſiſts in it, hath not yet felt the lively and powerfull work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit of Chriſt within him, opening his eyes, and drawing his heart to come to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> although they ſay, That no man hath any certain ground to beleeve that Chriſt hath ſuffered for him, and that he is redeemed by Jeſus Chriſt, except he beleeve that he hath ſuffered for all perſons.</p>
            <p>Yet it is moſt certain, that a ſinner,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98399:96"/>in whoſe heart and mind God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to reveal JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified, giving him to ſee the pretiouſneſſe of CHRIST, and his need of him, drawing or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him by his heavenly power to receive CHRIST, or beleeve in him for remiſſion of ſins, and life everlaſting, teaching him to ſet a high price upon the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, to embrace it, to truſt in it, and to account all things beſides loſſe and dung, enabling him withalll by the ſame power, ſincerely to love Jeſus Chriſt, to kiſſe his Scepter, to confeſſe his Name, to deny himſelfe, to take up his croſſe daily and follow Chriſt: I ſay, It is moſt certain, that ſuch a perſon doth freely beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt, he is a juſtified perſon through faith in Chriſt, he is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his righteouſnes, Chriſt is his, &amp; he is Chriſts, and he hath now no certain ground to beleeve, or to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that indeed Jeſus Chriſt is his Redeemer, and he is one of the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ones of Jeſus Chriſt. And then when God is pleaſed to goe yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98399:97"/>that is, to cleare up to him, by the teaching of his Spirit, the former gracious workings of God in him, and to witneſſe to his heart by the ſame Spirit, his reconciliation and Sonſhip, hee is now ſweetly aſſured and perſwaded, upon good ground, that Chriſt is his, and hee is Chriſts, that Chriſt loved him, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for him, that hee is the Son of God in Chriſt, an heire of God, a joynt heire with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe things that I have ſaid, are agreeable to the word of God, and to the cleare experiences of many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who are, and know themſelves to be, the redeemed ones of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet ſee no ground from Scripture to receive that opinion of Chriſts dying for all perſons. And as for them who are of that opinion, and make it the foundation of their faith, I adviſe them to take heed, that they build not their faith, hope, and comfort upon a ſandy foundation. So much for this.</p>
            <p>Sixteenthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> and laſtly, it is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by them, upon the Queſtion,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98399:97"/>That this <hi>Doctrine of Chriſts ſuffering for all,</hi> is the ſubject matter of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and that without this, no man hath any thing to preach to the world, no glad tidings, no remiſſion of ſins, no doctrine of reconciliation, no grace or peace at all. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by them in the 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 lines of page 17.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is moſt evident and certain, that this Doctrine of Chriſts ſuffering for all perſons, is not the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, nor the ſubject matter of the Goſpel, neither is ſuch a thing found in the Goſpel, nor in any part of the word of God, rightly underſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is ſtrange, that no man hath any thing to preach to the world, no glad tidings, no remiſſion of ſinnes, no doctrine of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except he preach, that Chriſt hath died for all perſons, and redeemed all perſons. I find that the Preachers of the Goſpel, of whom the Scripture makes mention, did diſpenſe or preach that one and the ſame Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in a divers manner, or method,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98399:98"/>according to the different eſtate of that people to whom they were to preach, to wit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some of the Jewes had a more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hand in betraying and crucifying the Lord of life.</hi> Now in preaching to theſe, Their endeavour was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that this Jeſus, whom they had crucified, was indeed the Sonne of God, the very Chriſt, that holy and juſt one, whom God had raiſed from the dead, and ſet him at his owne right hand, there expecting untill all his enemies be made his foot-ſtoole: And they did further teach them, That there was no way for them whereby to obtaine remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins and life everlaſting, but onely by this Ieſus whom they had crucified: and therefore they did ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly exhort them to returne to him, and believe in him for remiſſion of ſins, that ſo they might never any more be remembred againſt them, Acts, 2.22. to 39. and chapter 3.13. to 20. and chap. 4.10.11.12. and chap. 5.29.30.31.32.33. and chap. 7.51. to 57. And thus Chriſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98399:98"/>himſelfe to Saul, chapt. 9.4.5. <hi>Saul Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> And <hi>he ſaid who art thou Lord? And he ſaid, I am Jeſus,</hi> (marke that, I am Ieſus) <hi>whom thou perſecuteſt.</hi> Whilſt he is ſmiting of him to the earth, he declareth himſelfe to be a Ieſus, now ready to give him ſalvation in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, through faith in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe the generallity of the Iewes made their boaſt of their priviledges of the Law,</hi> that they were circumciſed, they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and God had made choyce of them, above all other Nations of the earth, to be a people to himſelfe; They were very zealous in the obſervations of the Law, and truſted that in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Priviledges, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the workes, and in the obſervations of the cuſtomes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Law, they ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine righteouſneſſe before God: for the Scripture ſaith they went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe, that is, they ſought righteouſneſſe by the priviledges and workes of the Law. Now in preaching to theſe,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98399:99"/>they did endeavour to bring them off from that opinion which they had of theſe things, and that confidence which they put in theſe things, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to them, with much power and boldneſſe, that there was no righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, nor ſalvation to be obtained any other way, but onely by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and grace of another, to wit, the Lord Ieſus, through faith in him: <hi>And that by him, all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of Meſes,</hi> Acts, 13.38.39. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to that Rom. 10.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe, There were ſome from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Gentiles, who did feare God, that is, they were worſhippers of God, they preached, and gave much Almes, and were very devout in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi> Of this ranke was Cornelius and all his houſe, Acts 10.1.2. Such were they alſo to whom Paul ſpeakes, Acts 13.16.26. Where you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that beſides <hi>the men of Iſrael, the Children of the ſtocke of Abraham,</hi> he ſpeakes to another ſort of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe, <hi>who did feare God;</hi> that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98399:99"/>is, They did come together amongſt the Iewes to worſhip God. Such a one alſo (as I conceive) was Lydia, before Paul did preach to her, The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Shee worſhipped God.</hi> And ſuch a one was that Ethiopian Eunuch, before Philip was ſent to him, <hi>He had beene at Ieruſalem for to worſhip.</hi> Now in preaching to theſe they did endeavour to bring them off, not from the things themſelves, (orderly to be done) but from putting confidence in theſe things; preaching remiſſion of ſinnes, and ſalvation to them onely through faith in Chriſt, that ſo they might not look for peace and reconciliation with God, by theſe workes of righteouſneſſe which they did, (though in themſelves good, and needfull for other ends) but onely by Ieſus Chriſt, and faith in him. This is evident from all the forementioned Scriptures, Acts 8.35. and 10.36. to 44. and 13.26. to 40. and 16.14. and 17.17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe, There were ſome amongſt the Gentiles, who were eminent for wordly wiſedome, prudence and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:98399:100"/>they were great diſputers and men of great abilities. Theſe did glory much in their wiſedome and learning, and accounted of moſt men, beſides themſelves, to be but fooles: and as for the preaching of Chriſt crucified, that was but a fooliſh thing in their apprehenſion. Theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the Scriptures called Greeks, or Grecians, ſuch as are wiſe. Theſe are thoſe of whom Paul ſpeakes, 1. Cor. 1.19. to 30. Now in preaching to theſe, or in diſputing with them, They did endeavour to beat them off from that opinion which they had of themſelves, and from that eſteeme which they had of their wiſedome, learning and prudence: teaching them that to know Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified, is the greateſt wiſedome, and that all is nothing, except they know Jeſus Chriſt, and believe in him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23.24. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.29. and 18.4.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.14.15.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe, The generality of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were people that were given to groſſe Jdolatry, and other great impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> Theſe are in Scripture called Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98399:100"/>Scythians; and ſuch as are unwiſe: For they were not eminent for wordly Wiſedome and learning, as the others were. Now in preaching to theſe, They did endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the vanity and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe practiſes, exhorting them earneſtly to forſake theſe vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to turne to the living and true God, and to believe in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, whom they did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make knowne vnto them. Acts 14.13. to 19. and 17.18. to the end, and 26.27. to 24.1. Theſ. 1.5. to the end.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, That the Preachers of the Goſpell, of whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures make mention, in preaching to the World, they did preach that one and the ſame Goſpel, in a divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or method, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent eſtate of that people to whom they did declare the ſame. But in all this we doe not find (neither is it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where found in the Scriptures) that they did declare to them, that Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered for the ſins of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But they did call upon them,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98399:101"/>in the Name of Ieſus Chriſt, to turne to him, to believe in him for remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes; declaring to them that there is no way whereby men can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſalvation, but onely through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: and that by him, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him ſhall receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, and evelaſting life. What I have ſaid herein is agreeable to the words of Chriſt in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.46.47. <hi>It behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nations, beginning at Jeruſalem.</hi> From whence we learne, That to preach the Goſpel to the World, or to the men of the world, it is to preach repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes to them in the Name of Ieſus Chriſt. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label>
            </p>
            <p>Now to preach repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins to the world in the Name of Chriſt, it is to declare to them, and to call upon them in the behalfe of Chriſt, that they forſake and caſt away all fleſhly confidence, ſuperſtitious vanities, and wicked practiſes, and turne to Ieſus Chriſt,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98399:101"/>&amp; believe in him onely for remiſſion of ſinnes: further declaring, That by him onely, whoſoever believeth in him ſhall have remiſſion of ſins.</p>
            <p>But it muſt be obſerved, That ſuch as preach repentance as relating to the Law, as a legall worke or duty, as a condition of righteouſneſſe, life and ſalvation, as a preparation or qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to Chriſt, or as ſomething to be done by us before we can have Chriſt, or believe in him unto remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins; Such doe not preach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remiſſion of ſins in the Name of Chriſt, they rather ſeeke to drive men from Chriſt, and bottom them upon ſome other foundation then Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now of the things which we have ſpoken, this is the ſumme: To preach the Goſpel to the World, it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to them the death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Ieſus Chriſt, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which God hath given him to judge the quicke and dead at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, calling upon them and beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them, in the behalfe of Chriſt, to forſake all fleſhly confidence, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98399:102"/>vanities and ſinfull practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to turne to Ieſus Chriſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him onely unto remisſion of ſins and everlaſting life: further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to them, that there is no way for them whereby to eſcapethe wrath of God, but onely through faith in Chriſt; and that through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive remiſſion or ſins, and the wrath of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yeth upon him, neither is there any other way for him to eſcape the ſame. What I have ſaid herein, we ſhall find agreeable to many Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Mark,</hi> 1.14.15. <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.12. compared with Luke 9.6. <hi>John</hi> 3.14.15.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. and 3.18.19. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now when the Preachers of the Goſpel have done this, when they have preached to the World Chriſt crucified and riſen from the dead, and have called upon men to turne to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and believe in him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misſion of ſins, and have declared to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98399:102"/>them, that there is no other Name whereby we muſt be ſaved, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we can eſcape the wrath of God, but onely the Name of that Ieſus which was crucified, and is riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from the dead: I ſay when they have done this, they muſt leave the iſſue to the Lord, who onely makes this Miniſtery powerfull to whom he pleaſeth, giving them repentance, that is, turning them from their iniquities unto Ieſus Chriſt, inabling them to believe in him unto remiſſion of ſins and everlaſting life. And ſurely God hath appointed the Miniſtery, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for this end, that by means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he might worke faith in all thoſe whom he hath ordained vnto eternal life. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.6.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. and 5.30.31. and 10.44. and 11.18. and 13, 47.48. and 16.14. and 28.24.28.</p>
            <p>And thus, as the Lord hath helped me, I have briefly declared, from the Scriptures, what it is for the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Chriſt to preach the Goſpel to the World. But that Chriſt hath ſuffered for the ſins of all perſons, that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98399:103"/>he hath redeemed all perſons, that he hath taken away the ſins of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that he hath redeemed all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that he hath wrought reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for all perſons, (as they ſay:) I find no where in the Goſpel, neither is it a agreeable to the Scriptures: And therefore to preach this, is not to preach the Goſpel of Chriſt, but ſomething which men have added to the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And thus I have declared the chiefe miſtakes and abſurdities which I find expreſſed by them in their ſeverall bookes, adviſing themſeives to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what ſnares they are entangled in, and exhorting others to be ware leaſt they be enſnared with theſe or the like things.</p>

               <hi>The concluſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, in the concluſion of this Treatiſe, I ſhall briefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſome few re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For whomſoever Chriſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98399:103"/>died, for them alſo he roſe againe, and for them he ſits at the right hand of God, and maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for them. This foure-fold golden chaine is ſo ſure and ſtrong that it can in no wiſe be broken or divided. It may, and is, and muſt be deſtingviſhed: but it neither may, nor muſt be broken. This fore-fold glorious worke of the Son of God, Paul linketh together in one golden chaine, Rom. 8.34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth?

<note place="margin">Eſa. 53.</note> and he was numbred with tranſgreſſors, and he beare the ſin of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi> whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the prophet linketh theſe together, <hi>He beare the ſin of many, and made interceſſion for
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98399:104"/>the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Thoſe whoſe ſins he bare, for them alſo he made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion. And the Apoſtle Iohn teacheth us, that thoſe for whom Chriſt is the <hi>propitiation,</hi> he is for them alſo an <hi>Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 1 Iohn 2.1.2. ſaith he, <hi>My little children, if any of us do ſin</hi> (though let us take heede of ſinning) <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous:</hi> how doth he prove that? ſaith he, <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins:</hi> that is, He who is the propitiation, or recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for our ſins, he is without doubt our Advocate alſo with the Father. And indeed propitiation and advocation are inſeperable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits: he that hath an intereſt in the one hath an intereſt in the other alſo. Propitiation is the ground of advocation, and advocation is a fruit neceſſarily and inſeperably flowing from propitiation. Neither is advocation without propitiation, neither doth propitiation go alone, to any perſons, without the power and benefit of advocation. And
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98399:104"/>therefore thoſe who go about to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide advocation from propitiation, they pervert the Scriptures, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Chriſt. And againe Paul wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, that thoſe who have a part in the death of Chriſt, they have a part in his reſurrection alſo, Rom. 4.25. <hi>He was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed againe for our juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all this that hath been ſaid, it is manifeſt, that whoſoever have a part in <hi>the death of Chriſt,</hi> they have a part <hi>in his reſurrection, in his ſitting at the right hand of God,</hi> and <hi>in his interceſſion alſo.</hi> And is this any leſſe then ſalvation? Thoſe who have a part in theſe things, are they not ſaved? Hence I conclude, that ſeeing all perſons have not a part in the benefit of his reſurrection, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, or interceſſion at the right hand of God, neither have they a part in the benefit of his death, or ſufferings: for theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits are inſeparably linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: they that have a part in the one, have a part in the other alſo.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:98399:105"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe whom Jeſus Chriſt redeemeth, he redeemeth them as he is a Prieſt, a King and a Prophet. <hi>Theſe are inſeperable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,</hi> whoſoever hath a part in one, hath a part in all: for though they muſt be diſtinguiſhed, they muſt not be divided. And thus indeed, the Son of God is a compleate Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Redeemer. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth not teach us, that Chriſt is a Redeemer, or Saviour, as he is a Prieſt onely, (to ſhed blood, or to offer ſacrifice) but as he is a King and Prophet alſo, <hi>applying to us</hi> the benefit of his Prieſthood or blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, <hi>ruling ih us, and teaching us</hi> the things which concern our peace. It is ſaid of <hi>Chriſt, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec.</hi> And what was this Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec? <hi>He was firſt by interpretation, King of righteouſneſſe, and after that alſo, King of Salem, which was King of peace.</hi> So that ſuch a Prieſt Chriſt was, a Kingly Prieſt, a ruling Prieſt, a teaching Prieſt, a Prieſt with a Crowne upon his head, and a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98399:105"/>of righteouſneſſe in his hand. And thus indeed Chriſt is a perfect and complete Saviour: Neither is he a Saviour to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ey in point of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation otherwiſe then as he is a complete and perfect Saviour to them, this thing Eſaiah teacheth, when he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 53.</note> 
               <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous</hi> ſervont juſtifie many: for he ſhall beare their iniquities. Where it is evident, that theſe to whom he is a Prieſt, <hi>bearing their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities;</hi> to them he is a Prophet alſo <hi>inſtructing them in the knowledge of himſelfe unto juſtification.</hi> Thus, he is a Ranſome, a Redeemer, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and no otherwiſe. And hence it appeares, that he ſhed not his blood for all perſons, neither have all a part in him, as he is a Prieſt, ſeeing that by his Kingly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall power, he doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to them the benefit of his Prieſthood: for theſe are inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefits, thoſe who have a part in one, have a part in all: and they who have not a part in all, have a part in none: and thoſe who go
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98399:106"/>about to divide theſe, they divide Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt ſhed his blood for none but thoſe upon whom he ſprinkles the ſame, to the purging of their conſcience, and the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſins. Neither doth the Lamb of God any otherwiſe take away the ſins of any, or redeeme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but by ſprinkling his blood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Neither doth his blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny otherwiſe take away our ſins, but as it is ſprinkled upon our conſcience by the Spirit of God, drawing our hearts to believe in him. Neither did he ſhed his precious blood for any (nor for any other end) but for thoſe upon whom he ſprinkles the ſame for remiſſion of ſins. This is moſt evident from thoſe paternes of heavenly things under the Law: <hi>For when Moſes had ſpoken every precept according to the Law, he took the blood of Calves and of Goats, with water, and ſcarlet wooll, and hyſſop, and SPRINKLED both the booke and the people, ſaying, This is the blood
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98399:106"/>of the Teſtament which God hath enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to you. Moreover, HE SPRIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KLED with blood both the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and all the Veſſels of the Miniſtery. And almoſt all things are by the Law purged with blood,</hi> that is, with the <hi>ſprinkling</hi> of blood: and without ſhedding of blood, that is, without the <hi>ſprinkling</hi> of the blood which is ſhed, there is no remiſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.18, 19, 20, 21, 22. And in the 13. verſe of the ſame chapter it is ſaid, <hi>That the blood of Bulls, and of Goats, &amp; the aſhes of an Heifer, SPRINKLING the uncleane, did ſanctifie to the purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fleſh.</hi> And whoſoever ſhall read with underſtanding, what the holy Spirit witneſſeth in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (<hi>Exod.</hi> 12.7.13. and 24.5, 6, 7, 8. and 29.16.20, 21. <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.5.11. and 3.2.2.8.13. and 4.6, 7, 17, 18, 25, 26, 30, 31. and 5.9, 10. and 7.2. and 8.15, 18, 19, 23, 24. and 9.12.18. and 14.6.7. and 19, 17 18, 19.) they ſhall find that the people were legally cleanſed by the <hi>ſprinkling</hi> of blood, and almoſt all things under the Law were purged by the <hi>ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling</hi>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:98399:107"/>of the blood ſhed; and without <hi>ſprinkling</hi> or <hi>application</hi> of the blood ſhed, there was no remiſſion or atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now if it was neceſſary that the paterns of heavenly things ſhould be thus purged, to wit, by the <hi>ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> or <hi>application</hi> of blood: then (without doubt) the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (of which thoſe was a patern) are ſo purged alſo: that is, there is no taking away of ſin, no reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, redemption, or atonement wrought for any, but by the <hi>ſprinkling</hi> or <hi>application</hi> of the blood of Chriſt upon them. Hence it is, that the blood of Chriſt is called the blood of <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. Neither is it any other way of uſe to us, neither doth it any other way ſpeake good for us before God, but as it is <hi>ſprinkled</hi> upon our conſcience by the power of the Spirit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Eſaias</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 52.15</note> 
               <hi>He ſhall SPRIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KLE many Nations,</hi> that is, he ſhall <hi>ſprinkle</hi> his blood upon them: <hi>For that which hath not been told them ſhal they ſee, and that which they have not heard, ſtall they underſtand.</hi> And thus
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98399:107"/>indeed Chriſt doth redeem or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe us with own blood. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer </seg>
               </label> Neither are any perſons redeemed, or purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or reconciled with the blood of Chriſt, neither have they any part in his death or blood-ſhed, who have not their conſciences <hi>ſprinkled</hi> with the blood of Chriſt.

And ſurely, the Son of Man did not faile to fulfill what was the <hi>End</hi> of his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> The Son of God did not come into the world, and lay down his life
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98399:108"/>to work a <hi>halfe</hi> redemption, or ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to work a <hi>perfect</hi> redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation. <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, That Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>Halfe</hi> to ſave them, but to <hi>ſave</hi> them: that is, <hi>fully</hi> to ſave them, to <hi>ſave</hi> them as <hi>Paul was ſaved:</hi> for ſuch a <hi>ſaving</hi> he there ſpeakes of. And Chriſt thus witneſſeth of himſelfe, The Sonne of Man is come to <hi>ſeek</hi> and to <hi>ſave</hi> that which was loſt; that is, to find out, and <hi>fully to ſave</hi> loſt ſinners; to <hi>ſave</hi> them as <hi>Zacheus was ſaved;</hi> for ſuch a <hi>ſeeking</hi> and <hi>ſaving</hi> he there ſpeakes of.
<note place="margin">Eſa. 53.</note> And <hi>Eſaias</hi> witneſſeth, that the very <hi>End</hi> of the travell of Chriſts ſoule was to bring forth a ſeed. Saith he, <hi>When thou ſhall make his ſoule an offering for ſinne; he ſhall ſee his ſeed.</hi> And again, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travell of his ſoule, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> This is a glorious myſtery. Why did the Son of God ſuffer ſuch <hi>child-bearing pangs?</hi> Why did he undergoe ſuch a <hi>painfull travell?</hi> Was it not to bring forth a ſeed? Was not this the <hi>very
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98399:108"/>end?</hi> It is therefore moſt certain, that the very <hi>end</hi> of the death of Chriſt, was to bring forth a ſeed, to work a full redemption, to ſave ſinners; that is,

Tit. 2.14. 1 Pet. 2.24. and 2.18. 1 Ioh. 3.5. and 4.9.</note> to heale them of their blindneſſe, pride, rebellion, obſtinacy; to deliver them from the power of ſinne and Satan, to make them alive, to bring them to God, to enable them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him unto remiſſion of ſinnes, and to carry them on in beleeving, by his power unto ſalvation. This is the redemption, and this the ſalvation which Chriſt <hi>came</hi> into the world to work. This was the very end of his dying.</p>
            <p>And I ſay further, That as the Son of God did come into the world, and ſuffered death for this very <hi>end:</hi> ſo hee did not faile to fulfill the ſame: For he was every way <hi>prepared</hi> to doe the work: hee wanted neither <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe, ability,</hi> nor <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> to doe the work moſt perfectly. Hence it is that the Scripture thus witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of him,

            </p>
            <p>Neither was his <hi>Willingneſſe</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> leſſe then his <hi>power:</hi> For he witneſſeth himſelfe,

<note place="margin">Eſa. 53.10 Iohn 17.4</note> ſaith. <hi>Hee did prrſper in the work which hee came to doe.</hi> And to put all out of doubt, Chriſt further witneſſeth of himſelfe, <hi>I have finiſted the work which thou gaveſt me to doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, if this was the very <hi>end</hi> of Chriſts comming into the world, and of his ſuffering in the world, To work a <hi>full, perfect,</hi> and <hi>eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:</hi> and if hee did not faile to fulfill and finiſh this worke: if hee did <hi>proſper</hi> in it: (for ſo the Scripture ſaith, <hi>By his own blood hee entred in once into his Holy place, having obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned eternall redemption:</hi>) men ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are much miſtaken, who ſay,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98399:109"/>that JESUS CHRIST died for all perſons, and that hee hath redeemed all perſons: Seeing that all thoſe whom Chriſt hath redeemed, he hath redeemed them with a <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>everlaſting redemption:</hi> And this was the very <hi>end</hi> of his death or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Reconciliation, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Atonement, Remiſſion of ſinnes, Justification,</hi> are in the Scripture ſenſe one and the ſame fruit, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit flowing from the death of CHRIST, through faith in him: and they are uſually in the Scripture put one for another. Let the Reader diligently conſider theſe Scriptures. <hi>Romans</hi> 5.8.9.10.11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 1.14.21.22. 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.18.19. In which laſt place the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelfe by</hi> JESUS CHRIST. And whereas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hee ſaith in the twentieth verſe, <hi>We pray you in Christs ſtead, bee reconciled unto God:</hi> he meaneth, Wee beſeech you <hi>to beleeve in Jeſus
<pb facs="tcp:98399:110"/>Christ</hi> unto reconciliation, or remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes. Neither are wee to underſtand this, as though thoſe to whom hee writes it, were now ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or unreconciled ones; (for it is againſt the ſcope and nature of the Epiſtle ſo to underſtand it; for it is certaine, he writes to them as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Chriſt, ſuch as were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God through faith in Chriſt.) But he here putteth them in minde, that when they did formerly preach the Goſpel to them, they came to them as the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, with the Meſſage of Chriſt, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them to beleeve in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus unto reconciliation, or remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Now then, if reconciliation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, atonement, remiſſion of ſinnes, not imputing of ſinnes, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, bee in the Scripture ſenſe one and the ſame fruit flowing from the death of Chriſt, through faith in him: and that it is uſuall in the Scripture to put one for another, as the underſtanding Reader may well
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98399:110"/>perceive: Then ſurely, redemption, atonement, reconciliation by Chriſt, is another thing then many took it for. And it is moſt ſure, that Chriſt died for thoſe onely who doe receive redemption, reconciliation, atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, remiſſion of ſins, juſtification by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus through the grace and help of GOD, I have finiſhed what I intended in handling theſe things, as alſo in declaring ſome Reaſons from the Scriptures to prove that JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST did not ſhed his blood, make an atonement, or worke redemption <hi>for all perſons.</hi> And yet it is moſt certaine (as I have before declared) that there is a glorious Goſpel, according to the command of Chriſt to his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to be preached by them to all nations; Which Goſpell he is about to cleare from all thoſe miſts of darkneſſe which doe yet be-dimme the ſplendor of it: And then ſhall the glory of it ſhine forth ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the mouth of his Meſſengers,
<pb facs="tcp:98399:111"/>that many who ſit in darkneſſe, ſhall, through the power of God in their Miniſtery, be brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith of the <hi>Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who ſo is wiſe, and ſhall obſerve theſe things: even they ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the loving kindneſſe of the Lord.</p>
